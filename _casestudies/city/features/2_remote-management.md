Edge devices running [NuvlaBox](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software can be remotely managed, using a secured connection, giving the customer full visibility and manageability of each edge device and the applications running inside them. Nuvla.io enables automated commissioning of edge devices as well as monitoring, updates and alerts.
