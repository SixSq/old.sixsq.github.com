In an smart airport, harbour or city transformation, starting with one vertical application, in this case video analysis or lighting, is easier and less risky than rolling out an entire horizontal platform. Operators can then follow up with the addition sensors and applications, such as audio analysis, air quality monitoring, security and much more, without costly intrusion into the critical infrastructure itself.
