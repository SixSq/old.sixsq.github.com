In partnership with [Schréder Swiss](http://www.schreder.com/fr-ch), SixSq has developed a smart street lighting solution which brings an unparalleled opportunity to deliver savings.  By implementing the [Volumlight](http://www.schreder.com/fr-ch/aboutus/Volumlight)&trade; solution, cities can **reduce energy consumption by at least 30%**, whilst still respecting safety standards. With this system, lighting levels are continually updated to reflect real-time traffic patterns, providing savings during periods of low circulation and ensuring safety at all times. Operational costs are also reduced thanks to its remote control capabilities.
