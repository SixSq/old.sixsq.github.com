Edge computing opens up new possibilities for the critical infrastructures (e.g. airports, harbours, highways and cities). Using the [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview) management platform, critical infrastructure operators have not only a real-time snapshot of what is happening throughout the area, but they can also analyse the data provided by edge sensors to manage resources, [fuse data](https://media.sixsq.com/blog/data-fusion-at-the-edge), inform planning and implement strong [governance](https://media.sixsq.com/blog/smart-city-governance-for-open-data-and-edge-computing). Plus they can update, add and upgrade their fleet of apps running at the edge at any time.

## Detecting significant events in the area

With our edge computing software solution, customers are able to run a wide range of apps at the edge (e.g. machine learning for real-time video and audio analytics), from the [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview) App Store. 

For example, in Florence, [THALES Transport](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/europe/germany/transportation-systems-service-solutions), as part of the [ELASTIC](https://elastic-project.eu) project, is leveraging Nuvla.io to manage edge devices installed in tramways and stops. This provides an unprecedented open platform to explore autonomy strategies for tomorrow's smart public transport systems.

Meanwhile, [ELEKTRON](https://www.elektron.ch/en/), the leading Swiss technology company, [teamed up with SixSq](https://sixsq.com/news/2020-09-14-news-elektron-trafficdim/) to create a next-generation connected Smart Street Lighting solution called [TrafficDim](https://www.elektron.ch/fr/produits-et-solutions/eclairage/routes/gestion-de-la-lumiere/trafficdim-controle). The solution leverages the power of the [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software, to automatically monitor road traffic and control adaptive street and highway lighting.

## Here's how it works:
