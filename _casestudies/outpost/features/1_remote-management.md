Edge devices running [NuvlaBox](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software can be remotely managed, using a secured connection, giving you full visibility and manageability of each edge device and the applications running inside them. This feature works on all IP connectivity, even if the edge device is connected to the network via a private IP.  It also works with intermittent connectivity, which is common in many field scenarios.
