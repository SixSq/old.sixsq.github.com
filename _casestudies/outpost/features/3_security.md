Once powered up, any edge device installed with [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software initiates a secured connection to [Nuvla.io](/nuvla-io/overview). Each edge device is then unique and assigned to a specific user organisation. This means that any device can be controlled remotely and isolated (quarantined), upgraded or downgraded should any problems arise.
