This project collects and processes at the edge 10s of TBs of data per day per station. It handles sustained and on demand upload of the data to cloud. All the data gets registered in Nuvla.io. The system automatically optimises transfer and usage of storage both at the edge and in the cloud based on capacity and/or cost. A real edge-to-cloud challenge.
