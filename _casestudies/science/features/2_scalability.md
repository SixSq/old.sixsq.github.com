This project builds on [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview) scalability feature. With 50 GNSS stations connected (a reasonable objective) the overall system would process 1PB of data at the edge daily, autonomously. With the ability for users to query data and deploy AI apps at the edge and in the cloud, we believe this architecture provides scale and flexibility never seen in this industry.
