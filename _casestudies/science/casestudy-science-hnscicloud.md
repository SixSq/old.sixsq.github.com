The Helix Nebula Science Cloud (HNSciCloud) project worked on developing commercial cloud services to help researchers manage and process the enormous amounts of data which will be generated by the scientific community in the coming years. The hybrid cloud platform was designed to enable a competitive marketplace of European cloud players developing their own services for a wider range of users. SixSq delivered the advantages of Nuvla, its multi-cloud management platform, to the project, giving the user group access a wide range of cloud services. SixSqâ€™s open source technology increases quality and speed of application deployment in any cloud.
