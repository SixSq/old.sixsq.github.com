Delivering AI to the Market
====

Our Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (AIoT) Partnership Programme is for organisations who want to bridge the gap between their AI software solution and customers. Many organisations face challenges in deploying distributed AI solutions and suffer from lack of access to developers with the required expertise. This is why we created **[Nuvla](/nuvla), the software platform for AI enablement at the edge**.
If you have an AI solution and are looking to reduce your time to market and deliver an as-a-service experience for your customers, this platform is what you need.  To give you an idea of our current activities, we work with partners in the following fields:

* **Smart cities**
* **Smart buildings**
* **Smart retail**
* **Industry 4.0**
* **Mobility**
* **Big Data Science**

Our AIoT partnership program accelerates the creation and delivery of applications in these fields and many more.
