NuvlaBox can host a range of operating systems and applications (e.g. different Linux flavours), as long as they are containerised and available for your chosen hardware platform (e.g. x86 or ARM). We have also documented how to build your own Docker images to take advantage of our advanced parameterisation and data management features.
