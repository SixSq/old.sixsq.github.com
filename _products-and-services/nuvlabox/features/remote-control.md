NuvlaBoxes are remotely controlled, using a secured connection, giving you full visibility and manageability of each edge device and the applications running inside of them. This feature works on all IP connectivity, even if the NuvlaBox is connected to the network via a private IP.  It also works with intermittent connectivity, which is common in many field scenarios.
