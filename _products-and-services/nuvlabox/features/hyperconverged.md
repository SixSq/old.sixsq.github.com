The NuvlaBox software turns any certified PC platform into a hyperconverged system, where users can "carve" as much resources as needed for a given application.  This means applications can happily run alongside each other, even on small devices, with minimum impact on each other. Via the SlipStream or Nuvla interface, virtual machines can be dynamically resized, to adapt to the application needs, without needing to change the hardware.
