Once powered-up, the box initiates a secured connection to [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview). Once the secured registration process is done, each NuvlaBox is unique and assigned to a specific user organisation. This means that any device can be controlled remotely and isolated (quarantined), upgraded or downgraded should any problems arise. We also work with expert partners to build the most secured edge solution, delivering solutions for stringent applications and highly regulated industries.
