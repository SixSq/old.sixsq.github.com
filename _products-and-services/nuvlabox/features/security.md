Once powered-up, the box initiates a secured connection to its mothership (e.g. Nuvla). Once the secured registration process is done, each NuvlaBox is unique and assigned to a specific user organisation. This means that any device can be isolated (quarantined), upgraded or downgraded, in case of problem, remotely.
