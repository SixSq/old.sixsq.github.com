Take advantage of existing templates, such as load balancers, database clusters, Hadoop systems and more. But don't stop there, you can extend these and create your own. You can also take advantage of configuration management systems, such as Puppet, Chef and Ansible. What about Docker? It's batteries included, with support for Docker, Docker Swarms and Kubernetes. And again, all this from the comfort of a managed service.
