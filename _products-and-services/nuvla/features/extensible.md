Take advantage of 1000s of existing Docker images, such as load balancers, database clusters, big data systems and more. But don't stop there, you can extend these and create your own. You can also take advantage of configuration management systems, such as Puppet, Chef and Ansible. You will need your own Docker Swarms (Kubernetes is coming soon) to deploy to. And again, all this from the comfort of a managed service.
