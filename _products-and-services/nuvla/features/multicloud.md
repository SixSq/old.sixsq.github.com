Nuvla allows you to configure any number of Container as a Service (CaaS) (e.g. Docker Swarm now and Kubernetes soon) endpoints. This means you can mix and match public clouds, private clouds and infrastructure, as well as edge devices such as the NuvlaBox. This enables a simple, yet effective, multi-cloud and infrastructure solution.
