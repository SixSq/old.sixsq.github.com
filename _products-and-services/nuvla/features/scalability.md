Nuvla is built for scale and extensibility. Nuvla v2 is fully micro-service based, making it simple and straightforward to scale. Built on top of Elasticsearch and Zookeeper, the stateful part of the system also scales horizontally by adding more container resources. If your private cloud is not giving you all you need, but you don't want to invest in more infrastructure, use Nuvla to scale out to a public cloud and get the best of both worlds.  This is hybrid IT in action.
