SlipStream is built for scale and extensibility. Built on top of Elasticsearch and Zookeeper, and using a micro-service architecture, the system scales horizontally by adding cloud resources.

The framework is also extensible, where developers can add modules, dynamically leaded. For example, connectors can be added to connect to any clouds. Authentication methods can also be added, to nicely mesh with existing infrastructures.
