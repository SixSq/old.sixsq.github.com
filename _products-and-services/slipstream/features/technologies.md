SlipStream is built using the [latest software technologies](/products-and-services/slipstream/tech-spec), tools and libraries. Taking advantage of the massive investments from the open source community, we leverage the Java eco-system, Clojure language, Elasticsearch database, Zookeeper coordination engine and DevOps tools.
