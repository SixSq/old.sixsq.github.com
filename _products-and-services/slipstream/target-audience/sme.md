The SlipStream service, which can be installed on a [NuvlaBox](/products-and-service/nuvlabox) or in the cloud provides SMEs with a one-stop shop for managing public and private cloud assets. It also allows them to control and monitor NuvlaBoxes, which are a great way to remotely manage distributed locations (e.g. clinics, shops) where a private infrastructure is needed but no local IT expertise is available.
