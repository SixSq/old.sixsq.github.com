The SlipStream service, which can be installed on a [NuvlaBox](/products-and-service/nuvlabox) or in the cloud provides SME with a single stop shop to manage public and private cloud assets. It also allows them to control and monitor NuvlaBoxes, which are a great way to remotely manage distributed offices (e.g. clinics, shops) where no local IT expertise is present, yet a where a private infrastructure is needed.
