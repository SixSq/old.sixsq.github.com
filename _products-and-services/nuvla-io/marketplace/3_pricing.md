The Nuvla.io marketplace pricing scheme is simple and transparent. The app vendor sets the subscription price. The usage is metered by the hour and invoiced monthly. SixSq takes 20% and pays the vendor 80% on payment by the customer. The metering starts only after 24 hours, giving the customer time to explore and valide the purchase.
