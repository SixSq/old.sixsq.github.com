The [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview) marketplace pricing scheme is simple and transparent. The app vendor sets the subscription price. The usage is metered by the day and invoiced monthly. SixSq takes a fee and pays the vendor the remaining amount on payment by the customer. The metering starts only after 24 hours, giving the customer time to explore and validate the purchase.
