Since the Nuvla.io marketplace is future proof, it also removes friction and therefore lock-in. The customer only pays for his or her consumption, by the hour, providing the freedom to change apps and apps vendors at any time. This reduces the risk of trying something new, at scale, therefore benefiting both app vendors and customers.
