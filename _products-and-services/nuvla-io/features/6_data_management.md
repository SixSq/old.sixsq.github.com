Data produced at the edge or in the cloud is managed, including data tagging, replication and transfer, as well as data search and access. This feature also works in semi-connected mode, such that in the case of a loss of connection, data transfer or replication resumes once the connection is re-established. Data can also be mounted directly inside the application container, massively simplifying data access.
