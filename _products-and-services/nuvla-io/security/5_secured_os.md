SixSq maintains the NuvlaBox OS (Operating System) as a secured Linux distribution for both x86 and ARM hardware architectures. 

This means you have a solid Linux foundation to run the NuvlaBox Engine and all your apps. We also share recipes to improve security at factory time, with secured boot, disk encryption and more.
