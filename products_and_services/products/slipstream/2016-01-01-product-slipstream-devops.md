                <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
                <p>DevOps brings together IT operations and software development. Traditionally, these two departments work alongside each other but not together, causing inefficiences and even friction. DevOps brings a collaborative way of working and organising which stresses communication and sharing. While once a geeky concept, it is now recognised by C-level executives as a powerful set of best practices and concepts that can yield
                significant benefits for enterprises embracing it.

                <h2>Where Does SlipStream Fit In?</h2>
                <p>DevOps requires you to streamline your software delivery process and reduce waste. Autmoated deployment and standardised production environments are key aspects of DevOps work.  SlipStream is an application deployment platform which delivers the automation required by DevOps.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                SlipStream enables a new
                level of automation, bringing real DevOps benefits to any organisation. Adding the
                right automation on top of an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), such as an open
                <a href="/products/slipstream/paas">PaaS</a>
                framework, makes DevOps a game changer and can reduce time to market and improve your   
                organisation's ability to push innovation faster.

                <h2>What are the benefits of DevOps?</h2>
                <p>Adopting DevOps will ensure continuous software delivery, faster resolution of problems, quicker delivery of features and shorter time to market. By
                reducing the number of manual tasks required to build development, testing, certification and
                production environments, your team will have more time to focus on adding value to your customers. There will be more time to spend on designing new features and smoothing out bugs.
                </p>
                <p>And since you create a constant dialogue between the IT operations and software development
                teams, you create software and services that are easier to operate, troubleshoot, upgrade and
                maintain.

                <h2>DevOps is all about Communication and Smart Sharing</h2>
                <p>How often do your teams re-invent the wheel? What if each time a team was able to configure
                a piece of software, this knowledge was then available to all other teams? What if you could let 
                teams deploy quality assured software systems directly into production, with no security 
                compromise? SlipStream makes this possible thanks to smart automation on private, public and/or
                hybrid cloud.
                </p>
                <p>You can also assemble applications from parts, like with Lego bricks, 
                simply reusing standard and legacy components.  You can give each DevOps team access
                to the entire knowledge base of your organisation.
