            <h2>SixSq</h2>
            <p>SixSq was founded in August 2007 by 3 partners. The company provides cloud neutral solutions which allow companies and institutions to benefit from cloud computing while avoiding lock-in. Its smart cloud-in-a-box appliance, NuvlaBox®, is a simple plug & play IT solution which brings customers a private cloud at an affordable price as well as playing an intrinsic part of smart city and IoT strategies. SixSq’s smart cloud brokerage platform, Nuvla®, offers application deployment from a single, simple dashboard. Nuvla® is powered by SlipStream®, the company’s cloud management platform, which allows users to deploy any application in any cloud.</p>
            <p>SixSq’s active participation in numerous international cloud initiatives has solidified its reputation as a leading European cloud expert.</p>
            <p>At the end of 2014, the company entered into a partnership with the RHEA Group, a leading supplier of systems engineering services and software solutions to the Aerospace and Security industries.</p>

      <h2>Software Artisans</h2>
          <p>We are software artisans, passionate about software development and technologies. We have learned our trade writing a lot of software. We also enjoy reducing software, using refactoring, or contributing to other's good ideas, such that we do not have to write so much ourselves.

      We hope you enjoy, or will enjoy, using our software; we also hope that you will help us through feedback write
      better software and continue build the best applications we possibly can.</p>
