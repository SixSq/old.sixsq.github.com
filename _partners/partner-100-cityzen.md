The CityZen initiative brings together Swiss companies with expertise in the field of Smart Cities and acts as a centre of competence for cities and communes which need advice on the concept, integration and realisation  of Smart City projects. Thanks to the expertise of SixSq and the other members of the initiative, CityZen covers all the issues which are key to any Smart City strategy: mobility, parking, energy, waste management, security and data management.
