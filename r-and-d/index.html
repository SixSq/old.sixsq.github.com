SixSq is at the frontier between innovative development and commercial exploitation. Two of the three co-founders of the company met at [CERN](http://cern.ch), the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, where the web was born. Strong of this background, SixSq continues to participate to innovative research and development projects, national and international.

This page summarises the project we are involved in, focusing on accelerating our development roadmap for [SlipStream](/products/slipstream) and [NuvlaBox](/products/nuvlabox).
