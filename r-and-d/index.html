SixSq is at the frontier between innovative development and commercial
exploitation.  SixSq was born from ideas created at [CERN](http://cern.ch),
the European Laboratory for Particle Physics. SixSq continues to
participate in research and development projects, both at the national
and international levels.

We bring our expertise and experience to projects in which we
participate while also taking advantage of the projects' international
collaborations to refine and to expand our
solutions: [SlipStream](/products/slipstream) and
[NuvlaBox](/products/nuvlabox).

The wider research community benefits from our commitment to
open-source development and our [customers](/customers) benefit
from the cutting-edge innovation coming from these projects.
