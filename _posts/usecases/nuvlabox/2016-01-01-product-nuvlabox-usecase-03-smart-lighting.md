As part of SixSq's drive to deliver affordable smart city solutions, the NuvlaBox has been integrated into a smart street lighting application which brings an unparalleled opportunity to **deliver savings** to customers who are struggling to address environmental issues while respecting safety standards. By implementing this solution, cities can reduce energy consumption by at least 30%. This solution has been developed in conjunction with [Schr√©der Swiss](http://www.schreder.com/fr-ch).
