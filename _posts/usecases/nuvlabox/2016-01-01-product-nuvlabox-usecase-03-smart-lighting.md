As part of SixSq's drive to deliver affordable smart city solutions, we have integrated the NuvlaBox into a smart street lighting solution which brings an unparalleled opportunity to deliver savings.  By implementing this solution, cities can **reduce energy consumption by at least 30%**, whilst still respecting safety standards. This solution has been developed in conjunction with [Schr√©der Swiss](http://www.schreder.com/fr-ch){:target="_blank"}.
