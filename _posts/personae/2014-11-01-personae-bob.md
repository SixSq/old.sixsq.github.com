Bob is the manager responsible of the users wanting to deploy apps in the cloud. He doesn't need to deploy applications himself. Bob is concerned with user access rights, quotas and usage. He also wants to understand how much users are consuming on each cloud. He also wants to understand what applications are deployed and how much resources they are using. He might eventually be the one paying for all this consumption, or liaise with the accounts manager.
