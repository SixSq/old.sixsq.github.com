overview: CIO, Team Leader and/or account manager

Bob is the manager responsible for the users wanting to deploy apps in the cloud. He doesn't need to deploy applications himself.

Bob is concerned with user access rights, quotas and usage. He wants a clear overview of how much users are consuming on each cloud.

He also wants to understand which applications are being deployed, how many resources they are using and how much this costs. He might be the one directly responsible for paying for all this consumption, or he may have to liaise with the accounts manager.
