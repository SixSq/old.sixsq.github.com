Try Nuvla For Free
======

Give Nuvla, our online [SlipStream](/products/slipstream) service, a try. The use of Nuvla is currently **free of charge**.  You only pay the cloud providers for the cloud resources you consume.

</p>


Creating a account on Nuvla takes a few seconds. Once logged in, you have a number of cloud services to choose from, so simply pick the one you fancy, or several, configure your account accordingly and you're good to go. We then suggest you start by taking the tour. 

We have put a lot of effort in the [documentation](http://ssdocs.sixsq.com), including an [advanced tutorial](http://ssdocs.sixsq.com/en/latest/advanced_tutorial/), which will give you great overview of cloud and an insight into the capabilities of Nuvla and the underlying [SlipStream](/products/slipstream) technology.
