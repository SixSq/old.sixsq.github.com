<h1>Pricing</h1>

SlipStream's pricing policy is simple and transparent. You will find below various flexible plans for the use of SlipStream:

<ul>
    <li><b>SaaS Plan</b>: Peace of mind with our SaaS offer (psst... it's free!)</li>
    <li><b>On-Premise Subscription Plan</b>: SlipStream on-premise in a pay-as-you go model</li>
    <li><b>On-Premise License Plan</b>: SlipStream on-premise in a single payment</li>
</ul>

In addition, we deliver SlipStream in a hardware turn key solution, called <a href="/products/nuvlabox.html">NuvlaBox</a>. 

<h1>SaaS Plan</h1>

If you prefer the peace of mind of a **SaaS** delivery model, you can  rely on our <a href="https://slipstream.sixsq.com">SlipStream hosted service</a>. The service is currently configured system-wide to talk to Amazon EC2 (eu-west) and ExoScale.

<h2>SlipStream cloud connection options</h2>

The free basic account on the SaaS allows you to provision to the system-wide cloud connectors - e.g. currently Amazon EC2 and ExoScale. It will soon be possible to instantiate your own connectors.  This will allow you, for example, to connect to your own cloud, or a [NuvlaBox](/products/nuvlabox.html), without having to deploy your own SlipStream instances.

Of course if you prefer to have your own SlipStream instance, you can purchase it, under a flexible [subscription](/products/slipstream-pricing.html#on-premise-subscription-plan) or [license](/products/slipstream-pricing.html#on-premise-license-plan) plan.

</ul>

<h1>Definitions</h1>

The following are terms used in the context of SlipStream, referred to when defining license capabilities and constraints. 

<ul>
    <li><b>Connector</b>: A connector is an instance of a specific software component that allows a SlipStream server to interface with a specific IaaS cloud service, normally for a specific region and/or zone. For example, connectors are normally designed to point specifically to a single region for a given cloud.  It is therefore standard practice to have several separate instances of the same connector (class) to interface SlipStream with several regions of the same cloud. License restrictions therefore normally refer to connector instance.</li>
    <li><b>Open source connector</b>: this refers to a connector released under an open source license (normally the same license as the SlipStream Server). SixSq® normally releases connectors which interface with open source IaaS implementations under an open source license.</li>
    <li><b>Proprietary (closed source) connectors</b>: this refers to connectors released under a proprietary license. SixSq® normally releases connectors which interface with a proprietary IaaS implementation or service under a proprietary license.</li>
    <li><b>Active User</b>: a user refers to an active user, as in the sense of SlipStream. Only active users can perform any type of action in the system.</li>
    <li><b>Release</b>: a release is identified using three numbers, dot separated.  For example, 2.0.6.</li>
    <li><b>Major release</b>: a major release refers to the first number of the release string. For example the major release number for 2.0.6 is 2.</li>
    <li><b>Minor release</b>: a minor release refers to the second number of the release string. For example the minor release number for 2.0.6 is 0.</li>
    <li><b>Release number</b>: a release number refers to the third number of the release string. For example, the release number for 2.0.6 is 6.</li>
    <li><b>Deployment</b>: a deployment in the context of SlipStream is the creation of one virtual machine or several virtual machines deployed together.</li>
    <li><b>Image creation</b>: an image creation in the context of SlipStream is the creation of a new machine image, from an existing native image.</li>
    <li><b>SixSq SlipStream SaaS</b>: this app store is a SlipStream service managed by SixSq® and offered as a SaaS. This service is available as is, without any guarantees of availability.  It holds a number of images and deployments, which can be used and exported to a private SlipStream instance.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Licensing Rules</h1>

The following licensing or subscription rules are applicable to SlipStream:

<h2>Connector</h2>

Each connector must be attached to a SlipStream Server bundle. For example, in the case where a customer already has reached the limit of the number of allowed connectors for his/her SlipStream Server license or subscription, if he/she wants to support an extra proprietary cloud, he/she will need to purchase a supplementary Extra Connector license or subscription, as well as a Proprietary Connector license or subscription. On the other hand, if the customer wants to support a new open source cloud, only the Extra Connector license or subscription is required.</li>

Each proprietary connector must be associated to a SlipStream Server license or subscription. In other words, a proprietary connector cannot be purchased alone.

The license or subscription bearer is required to upgrade regularly, within the next full quarter, such that he/she always runs the latest version minus one minor version.  If this constraint is not possible, a special maintenance and support contract is required.

<h2>Server Instances</h2>

A SlipStream license or subscription bearer gives right to a single instance of the service.  Via its connector, however, it can federate IaaS clouds installed in a number of different sites. 

<h2>Notes</h2>

Please note the following:

<ul>
    <li>We reserve the right to change this pricing and conditions at any time</li>
    <li>All prices exclude VAT</li>
    <li>All software is delivered from our web platform</li>
    <li>SixSq guarantees full backward compatibility for minor releases or upgrade script will be provided</li>
</ul>
