Many companies see the need to maintain at least part of their cloud infrastructure at home. Meanwhile, the ability to burst or scale-out to public or remote clouds can yield significant tactical, strategic and cost benefits. This is where the hybrid cloud model becomes an attractive option. However, many orgaisations already struggle with the complexity of managing their own cloud infrastructure, putting the hybrid model out-of-reach.

What if we had a simple tool able to abstract the difference between private and public clouds, such that users could provision on either or both without being exposed to the complexity and differences of each? What if we could deploy the same application across several clouds, regions and tiers, as if deployed on a single infrastructure? This would allow service delivery with a higher availability and resilience, without extra complexity.

This is a job for SlipStream. With its cloud abstraction layer, cloud differences are hidden, so that users can choose which cloud to target. Furthermore, with the ability to describe deployment logic in a cloud agnostic fashion, SlipStream is able to ensure that each application is deployed in the same way on each cloud, delivering the same result to end-users. The coordination feature of SlipStream that controls the order in which applications are installed, configured and started also works across clouds, further abstracting complexity when deploying in hybrid mode.

With the ability to deploy applications across several clouds with *1-click*, hybrid deployment is now within reach of all cloud-user organisations, allowing teams to take full advantage of private and public clouds, in a flexible, convenient and stress-free way. The result can significantly contribute to increasing robustness and availability of applications, without compromise on security or extra costs and complexity.

CIOs can then ensure the right infrastructure is used to host the right applications, providing an agile infrastructure for their organisation, whilst maintaining control and governance.
