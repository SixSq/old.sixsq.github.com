Hybrid cloud is an integrated cloud service which uses both public and private cloud infrastructures to perform different jobs within an organisation. Companies employ their staff on the best task to fit their skills, so why not apply the same logic to cloud? Understandably, a high percentage organisations prefer to maintain at least part of their cloud infrastructure at home. However, the ability to burst or scale-out to a public cloud can yield significant tactical, strategic and cost benefits. This is where the hybrid cloud model becomes an attractive option. However, many organisations already struggle with the complexity of managing their own cloud infrastructure, and can't contemplate taking on board a hybrid cloud model. 

SlipStream makes this step easier, by providing a simple tool able to abstract the difference between private and public clouds, allowing users to provision on either or both without being exposed to the complexity and differences of each. Users can choose which cloud to target and SlipStream ensures that each application is deployed in the same way on each cloud, delivering the same result to end-users. 

With the ability to deploy applications across several clouds in *1-click*, hybrid deployment is now within reach of all cloud-user organisations, allowing teams to take full advantage of private and public clouds, in a flexible, convenient and stress-free way. The result can significantly contribute to increasing robustness and availability of applications, without compromise on security or extra costs and complexity.

Mangers can then ensure the right infrastructure is used to host the right applications, providing an agile infrastructure for their organisation, whilst maintaining control and governance.
