Cloud offers are growing providing increasing level of choice and hopefully creating a healthy pressure to keep price low and quality high.
However, several CIOs are under pressure to make the the right choice, since changing cloud provider is currently expensive as each have their own API and value proposition.
Being able to take advantage of this plethora of choice without an important switchover cost would reduce the risk of backing the wrong horse. In addition, difficult decisions
often result in taking longer to reach the decision, possibly at the price of delayed implementation. Having the possibility to federate several clouds under the same
*broker* or *facade* would alleviate the risk of choosing the wrong cloud.

Further, being able to use a wider range of cloud providers can be a smart strategic choice to ensure optimum uptime. Indeed cloud services are not infallible, therefore using
more than one basket can be a simple solution to alleviate this risk. Being able to use different cloud providers can also mean having better geographical coverage
in terms of applications placement. For example, being able to deploy applications in specific countries or regions can be important.

Another important benefit is scale. A federated cloud resource is much likely to scale better than a single provider, such that peak demand can more easily
be absorbed, even with a very short-notice request.

What if we could provision to many different clouds, using the same interface? What if we could describe in a cloud-neutral way application deployment logic, allowing
applications to be deployed on any cloud in exactly the same way? What if selecting a cloud provider was as simple as selecting a roaming mobile operator?

This is exactly why the Helix Nebula public/ private partnership chose SlipStream to implement its federated provisioning engine for its [Helix Nebula](http://hnx.helix-nebula.eu/) Exchange (HNX) [production
service](http://www.helix-nebula.eu/). Users, such as [CERN](http://cern.ch), [ESA](http://esa.int) or [EMBL](http://embl.org), now describe their application deployments in SlipStream, using simple scripting, and simply choose the cloud to deploy to. HNX
currently includes cloud offers from [Atos](http://atos.net), [CloudSigma](http://cloudsigma.com), [Interoute](http://interoute.com) and [T-Systems](http://t-systems.com), with several cloud providers expected to join the new service.

With a simple, yet effective, service catalogue feature, SlipStream users can easily compare cloud capabilities, capacity and pricing, and then select the cloud service
they want to use. On their side, cloud providers can regularly update their service catalogue, to ensure their service remains competitive.     

Finally, the Helix Nebula collaboration re-skinned SlipStream, providing an integrated user experience, including colour, logos and documentation.

Note that a cloud connector license in required for each enabled cloud endpoint. Web UI re-skinning can be done simply by changing the application's CSS files and HTML templates.
