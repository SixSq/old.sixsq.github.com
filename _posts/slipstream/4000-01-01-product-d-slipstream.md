**1-click multi-cloud application deployment platform. Real multi-cloud solution built on open source software.**

All Clouds Supported
========

SlipStream communicates with IaaS clouds services via a connector architecture. We now support all mainstream clouds.

This means SlipStream isolates you from the details of the cloud, giving you freedom of choice, such that you can focus on your business.

Key Principals
=========

SlipStream is an application deployment automation platform, built on the following key principals:

* **Real multi-cloud**: SlipStream supports all mainstream cloud solutions and more. Your recipes and blueprints are truly independent of the target cloud solution or provider. You can also take advantage of this neutrality by deploying across several clouds concurrently.

* **No voodoo magic**: Everything is above board, with a simple yet rich set of functionality to create, share and use application deployments.

* **Freedom of choice**: SlipStream supports all mainstream IaaS cloud solutions, giving you the freedom to choose the right cloud solutions and providers to do the job

* **No modification to your application required**: SlipStream's simple script-based automation means that you can deploy any apps without any changes required. We also support all standard configuration management solutions, such as Chef and Puppet.

* **Full multi-tenant support**: Users can control who sees what, with private, group and public sharing policies.

* **Built-in version control**: All key artefacts in the system are version controlled, ensuring nothing is ever lost.
