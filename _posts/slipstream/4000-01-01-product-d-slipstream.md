**SlipStream<sup>Â®</sup>: 1-click multi-cloud application deployment platform. Real multi-cloud software solution built on open source software**

What does SlipStream give you?
=========

**Financial benefits:** SlipStream is a cloud software, a deployment automation tool which allows you to deploy applications automatically, thereby reducing time spent on configuring and installing applications

**Reduced time to market:** Use SlipStream as a solid foundation for your DevOps process.

**Reduced operational costs:** Redeploy your engineering skills to more innovative and creative tasks.

**Simplified configuration and installation of your software:** Use SlipStream as your Enterprise Open App Store.

**Self-service Provisioning**: Self service IT, commonly known as cloud self service, is becoming increasingly important. It gives end user the possibility to self-provision resources and set up or launch a service or application without the intervention of dedicated IT personnel, thereby increasing efficiency and freedom to make the right choice. SlipStream's simple script-based process automation means that you can deploy any app with no changes required. We also support all standard configuration management solutions, such as Chef and Puppet.

**DevOps Cloud Solution** Communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and IT operations professionals can only maximise the predictability, efficiency, security and maintainability of your operational processes. End-to-end operational efficiency will save your business time and money.

**Freedom of choice**: SlipStream supports all mainstream cloud solutions and more (see below). Your recipes and blueprints are truly independent of the target cloud solution or provider. You can also take advantage of this neutrality by deploying across several clouds concurrently, giving you the freedom to choose the right cloud solutions and providers to do the job

**Enterprise App Store**: Use SlipStream to build your app store through simplified configuration and installation of your software

All Clouds Supported
========

SlipStream communicates with IaaS clouds services via a connector architecture. We now support all mainstream clouds.

This means SlipStream isolates you from the details of the cloud, giving you freedom of choice, such that you can focus on your business.
