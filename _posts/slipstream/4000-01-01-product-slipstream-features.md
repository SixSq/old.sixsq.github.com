Features
==============

In more detail, SlipStream provides the following features: 

* **Multi-machine Provisioning System**: SlipStream allows users to define and execute deployments, based on high-level recipes, independently from the cloud on which the recipes will be applied.  Deployments include coordination and orchestration of virtual machines, including ordering and synchronisation of services. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the SlipStream™ control dashboard of a multi-machine deployment.

  For example, users can deploy, in a single action, on-demand, entire mutli-tier software systems. With SlipStream, this operation takes a few minutes, often compared to hours if not days using custom solutions. 

* **Multi-cloud Provisioning**: SlipStream supports multi-cloud deployments. This means users have the choice of a number of cloud service providers and technologies (public and/or private) when deploying virtual machines, from within the same SlipStream service. Furthermore, users can choose to deploy different parts of a deployment on different cloud services or regions, such that redundant and resilient behaviour is reached.  Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the SlipStream™ control dashboard of a multi-cloud deployment.  SlipStream™ supports different clouds using a connector design.  The available connectors are listed in Table 1.

  To illustrate, users can deploy applications (e.g. computing clusters, load balanced applications, multi-media processing pipelines) across several cloud providers, in order to improve data proximity & resilience, while reducing costs.

* **Support continuous integration processes with continuous deployment**: SlipStream encourages users to parameterise image creation and deployment recipes, such that key parameters (e.g. software version, package location, dependencies, inter-relationships) can be provided at runtime. This means that it is easy to integrate SlipStream with continuous integration servers to provide a full deployment chain. 
	
  For instance, users can provision complete server-side systems in a single action in order to test and certify a specific version of the system.

* **Independence from specific IaaS interfaces and hypervisors**: the SlipStream recipes are independent of specific IaaS interfaces, therefore avoiding vendor lock-in, allowing you to focus on configuration and deployment, instead of the specifics of each IaaS. 

  For example, users can seamlessly apply the same image construction recipes and multi-machine deployments to different cloud providers, yielding the same results every time.

* **Community sharing platform**: the SlipStream data model permits users to decide to share their image and deployment recipes with other users, thus contributing to a community effort, something dear to agile and DevOps principles.
