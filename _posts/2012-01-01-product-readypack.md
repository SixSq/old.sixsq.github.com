Simple, yet powerful, cloud solution for small and medium enterprises.  The DS-Cloud Ready Pack is the result of a tight collaboration between [IBM](http://ibm.com), [Darest](http://www.darest.ch) and SixSq.

This new product announced by IBM on March 15 is an entry point into private cloud computing, based
on open source software.
The solution, hosted on IBM hardware, packaged and distributed by Darest and powered by SixSq's cloud
software solution, offers an affordable solution for small to moderate cloud size.

This Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution includes the [StratusLab](http://stratuslab.eu) stack (which includes [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org) for managing virtual machines) and is configured
to work with the [KVM hypervisor](http://www.linux-kvm.org). The solution is also augmented with [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html), SixSq's automated deployment engine. This means that automated, reproducible and safe provisioning of entire virtual environments is available, right from the start.

A series of innovative services are also offered, with for example:

* **Reference Marketplace Service**: including certified and updated reference virtual machines
* **Reference SlipStream Service**: including automatically created reference virtual machines
  ready to use in deployments
* **Monitoring Service**: providing near-realtime monitoring of physical and virtual machines
  with automatic alert and intervention (optional and according to agreed SLA)
* **Custom turn key solution**: including the entire software stack required by the customer
  organisation. This offer is managed as dedicated projects, where the DS-Cloud Ready Pack is
  a core building block.

The DS-Cloud Ready Pack can also be interconnected to an elastic cloud service, making cloud bursting possible, therefore allowing users to seize their private cloud for nominal operations, instead of over-provisioning their solution. Further, the outbursting solution, being pre-integrated, comes at no extra software or configuration costs.
