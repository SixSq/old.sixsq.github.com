Simple, yet powerful, IaaS and PaaS cloud solution for small and medium enterprises.  With emCloud, SixSq's embedded cloud solution, you can deploy your own private cloud within minutes. emCloud is delivered as a software bundle or a turn key solution (factory certified hardware and
software), including support, maintenance and training services, allowing you can focus on your operations.

This new product is an entry point into private cloud computing, based entirely on open source software.
The solution, packaged and distributed by SixSq, offers an affordable solution for small to moderate sized clouds.

The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solution includes the [StratusLab](http://stratuslab.eu) stack for managing virtual machines and is configured to work with the open source industry leader [KVM hypervisor](http://www.linux-kvm.org). The solution also includes the [SlipStream™](/products/slipstream.html) PaaS, SixSq's multi-cloud provisioning and image factory automation engine. This means that automated, reproducible and safe provisioning of entire virtual environments is available, right from the start.

The hardware solution comes in **two** flavours. Note that both solutions can be *stacked*, meaning that more hardware can be
added to increase the capacity of the system, if and when demand grows.

* **Consumer**: a small form factor with enough resources to manage a small number of VMs. Can be placed in an office or meeting
  environment.
* **Enterprise**: a mini-tower or blade-type packaging, able to nicely integrate in rack-based installations or back-office
  environment.

This compact cloud solution can be interfaced with SixSq's innovative services:

* **Reference Marketplace Service**: including certified and updated base virtual machines
* **Reference SlipStream™ Service**: including automatically created reference virtual machines
  ready to use in deployments
* **Monitoring Service**: providing near-realtime monitoring of physical and virtual machines
  with automatic alert and intervention (optional and according to agreed SLA)
  
SixSq can also develop **custom deployments and image creation recipes** to help you automate part of or your entire
development, certification and production deployment value chain.

The emCloud solution can also be interconnected to an elastic cloud service, making cloud bursting possible, therefore allowing you to use your emCloud for nominal operations, instead of over-seizing it for peak scenarios.

Finally, SixSq has a strong heritage in distributed systems, which we bring to this solution in the form of federated emCloud solutions.  This means several emCloud solutions can be interconnected to maximise sharing and
optimise resource utilisation.
