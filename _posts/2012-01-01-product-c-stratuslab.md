Open-source IaaS cloud distribution. Turn your physical infrastructure into
powerful IaaS cloud in minutes, based on solid and proven open source software.

European Open Source Cloud Distribution
================

StratusLab is a European open source (Apache 2.0) Infrastructure as a Service
cloud distribution. SixSq is a founding member of the collaboration and a
core committer.

The aim of StratusLab is to provide a simple yet powerful IaaS distribution
such that users can create their own cloud, either as private
or public. Federation is in the StratusLab DNA so that several clouds can
be interconnected via a shared Marketplace and interconnected storage services. 

In fact, for simple deployments, system
administrators can turn existing physical infrastructures into IaaS cloud
within minutes. The idea being that simple things should be simple, this is
why the StratusLab distribution ships with sensible defaults, which will work
in most of the standard deployment scenarios.

With the release of version 2.1, the fully open-source StratusLab distribution
offers a complete solution for creating and managing cloud-based
infrastructures. It includes the OpenNebula virtual infrastructure manager;
a Marketplace allowing cloud users to create, search for and share
customised digitally-signed
virtual machine images; persistent storage allowing users to create and access
disks on remote cloud storage resources; a registration and common authentication
service; and a comprehensive set of easy-to-use command-line tools for
system administrators and end-users.

Why is SixSq Investing in StratusLab?
======

StratusLab give SixSq the ability not only to take advantage of cloud
services and technology, but to integrate, adapt and enhance cloud directly in
its solutions. Few companies master the entire IaaS -> PaaS -> SaaS stack.
SixSq does and coupled with [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html), we
have the ability to deliver a market leading solution for private infrastructure
with an unmatched level of automation.
