Field operations such as from journalists (e.g. sports event, international conferences, emergency coverage) and aid workers (e.g. relief efforts, aid camps) require a local IT infrastructure.

During the launch of the NuvlaBox at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014, we met several journalists. Holding the NuvlaBox one of them said "I wish we had had your NuvlaBox during the Sochi 2014 Olympics. Our local IT infrastructure took a long time to setup and was not brilliant". This illustrates that a platform that can be used by non-IT specialists to simply and securely deploy applications in a local IT infrastructure has great value. When combined with the ability to *call home* in a secure manner, as is required by journalists for example to deliver their material, such platform can make a real difference.

With its App Store and ability to 1-click deploy applications and ability to run up to 8 virtual servers locally, the NuvlaBox is an ideal solution. Indeed, once the NuvlaBox has been loaded with the right base images, the App Store can deploy autonomously (i.e. without needing network access) applications to support field operators. Further, since field operators can deploy applications themselves, significant cost can be saved by letting technical staff focus on more added value tasks and support.

In the context of aid work, the NuvlaBox can also create a Wi-Fi network, which can be used to disseminate important information to other aid workers and citizens alike.

If an external network is available - e.g. via satellite link - even for short period of times, the NuvlaBox can then *call home* where it can then be remotely accessed. This allows operators to monitor the box, but also automatically update image recipes and blueprints, perform maintenance tasks and backup important data.


Pricing
----

The catalog price of a NuvlaBox is [â‚¬1495](/products/nuvlabox-pricing.html). It contains all the required features for local operations, including the ability to create new deployment recipes/blueprints to augment the app store.

Each application to be deployed on the box will require a recipe/blueprint, which takes the form of a few scripts and configuration. SixSq will be happy to help you with this task, via our professional [*Recipe Creation Service*](/products/nuvlabox-pricing.html).

To remote control boxes, you will need a SlipStream instance. [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) is the software piece that contains the intelligence including the multi NuvlaBox dashboard. While SixSq runs SlipStream as a SaaS, you will most probably want to run your own for this type of usage. Please refer to the SlipStream pricing page for details. Note that you will need a connector instance per box. We support both permanent and subscription license schemes. Bulk pricing is also available on request.

If you need deployment recipes or blueprints to automate application deployment, SixSq will be happy to help you with this task, via our professional service.  Just get in touch.
