Network and internet service providers constantly have the issue of better control and handover at the edge of their network. For example, ensuring that the link between the end of their network and the entry-point to the customer's private infrastructure is as smooth as possible.

A number of measures can help here:

1. firewall to protect the customer's private network
2. cache services for popular data
3. backup service enabling offsite data stream at night or during low network utilisation
4. many more...

The problem is how to provide this type of functionality in a convenient, homogeneous way, at an affordable price for the customer, yet maintaining a low operation cost for the provider?

The NuvlaBox is ideally suited for this mission. The local App Store can be factory loaded with a set of apps defined by the provider. These can either be remotely provisioned by the provider or locally by the customer, depending on the provider's preference.

Using the ability to control and monitor many NuvlaBoxes from the same pane of glass, via [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html), means that the network provider can optimise its operations, streamline costs and batch control all NuvlaBoxes.

Each application to be deployed on the box will require a recipe/blueprint, which takes the form of a few scripts and configuration. SixSq will be happy to help you with this task, via our professional *Recipe Creation Service*.

To remote control boxes, you will need a SlipStream instance. [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) is the software piece that contains the intelligence including the multi NuvlaBox dashboard. While SixSq runs [SlipStream as a SaaS](/products/slipstream-tryme.html), you will most probably want to run your own version for this type of usage.
