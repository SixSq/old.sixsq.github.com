Directors of schools, like most leaders of non-IT organisations, understandably want to focus on their primary mission, which is to educate children. For them, IT is generally seen as a necessary evil and too often a distraction. They run most of their applications on their own hardware, resulting in a plethora of support and maintenance contracts for both hardware and software.  Maintenance and support interventions for the applications often require on-site visits by a specialist, yet another addition to the overall cost.

NuvlaBox radically simplifies this by tackling the issue on two fronts:

1. **Rationalise the hardware** by turning existing servers into virtual servers and running them on a single box: NuvlaBox. With up to 8 virtual servers (virtual machines) per NuvlaBox, the scale factor is significant. You can even stack NuvlaBoxes to increase capacity.
2. **Automate software deployment** by using an App Store to deploy applications and operating systems. This means non-IT specialists can deploy and configure complex applications, with no compromise on security. Furthermore, with the secure remote control feature supported by NuvlaBox, off-site specialists can remotely manage the box and its hosted applications, saving on travel costs and improving response time. 

With the generalisation of applications for schools and the tendency for school to federate, the ability to securely manage and remote control NuvlaBoxes also means that IT knowledge can be centralised, yielding even higher savings, while delivering a higher level of service.

To rationalise your hardware, you simply need to purchase a NuvlaBox. At at a [catalogue price of â‚¬1495](/products/nuvlabox-pricing.html), you will be able to run up to 8 virtual servers. Out of the box, everything you require is activated.

If you need deployment recipes to automate application deployment, SixSq will be happy to help you with this task, via our professional [*Recipe Creation Service*](/products/nuvlabox-pricing.html).

To remote control a box, you will need an account on our SlipStream managed service (SaaS) or deploy your own SlipStream instance. [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) is the software piece that contains the intelligence including app store capability. Creating an account on the SaaS is free, but you will need to activate a connection for each NuvlaBox managed (refer to the [NuvlaBox Remote Control feature on the pricing page](/products/nuvlabox-pricing.html)).
