In our ever-connected world, company presence at large fairs or events requires an IT presence. This means potentially:

1. video stream setup
2. application demonstrations
3. multi-screen organisations
4. etc

In addition, network access is often at a premium at a large fair, tied with bandwidth restrictions. This calls for a compact, local IT infrastructure, able to work in autonomous mode. Further, the ability to deploy its own local Wi-Fi network can be used to link all devices reducing wiring and increasing mobility of people staffing the booth.

NuvlaBox is the perfect solution for such an event. Once the applications have been cached in the box, they can be deployed in 1-click. This means the box can be setup with all the necessary applications in minutes, freeing time to generate real business. If the NuvlaBox can be attached to a local network that has access to the WAN, then it can also be remote controlled, increasing flexibility.


Pricing
----

The catalogue price of a NuvlaBox is [â‚¬1495](/products/nuvlabox-pricing.html). It contains all the required features for local operations, including the ability to create new deployment recipes/blueprints to augment the app store.

Each application to be deployed on the box will require a recipe/blueprint, which takes the form of a few scripts and configuration. SixSq will be happy to help you with this task, via our professional [*Recipe Creation Service*](/products/nuvlabox-pricing.html).

To remote control boxes, you will need a SlipStream instance. [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) is the software piece that contains the intelligence including the multi NuvlaBox dashboard. While SixSq runs SlipStream as a SaaS, you will most probably want to run your own version for this type of usage. Please refer to the [SlipStream pricing page](/products/slipstream-pricing.html) for details. Please note that you will need a connector instance per box. We support both permanent and subscription license schemes. Bulk pricing is also available on request.

If you need deployment recipes or blueprints to automate application deployment, SixSq will be happy to help you with this task, via our professional service.  Just [get in touch](mailto:info@sixsq.com).
