Features
==============

NuvlaBox can host up to 8 virtual servers.  This means you can replace 8 servers with a single NuvlaBox, with the corresponding reduction in complexity, costs and headaches.

    <h3>Private cloud turn-key cloud solution for small to medium-sized enterprises</h3>
    <p>NuvlaBox is about the size of a modem and comes pre-configured making it simple to use.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Ability to run up to 8 virtual machines on the NuvlaBox</h3>
    <p>No need for a farm of servers, with different maintenance contracts and corresponding administrative headaches. You size your virtual machines and deploy applications, without needing to procure new hardware. If you run out of resources on the NuvlaBox, simply stack NuvlaBoxes together, as a single unit.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <h3>Remote control several NuvlaBoxes from the same dashboard</h3>
    <p>NuvlaBoxes can be remotely controlled from the SixSq Enterprise Open App Store.  This means that you can securely remote control your boxes and deploy applications from a single dashboard. This feature works even if the NuvlaBox is connected to the network via a private IP.</p>
