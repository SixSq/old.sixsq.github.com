**NuvlaBox<sup>®</sup>: The power of the cloud as a remote controlled appliance packaged in a fanless PC.** 

Key Principals
========

* **Designed in Switzerland** and **built in Europe** 

* The NuvlaBox is a **local cloud solution** for small to medium-sized enterprises and home use

* NuvlaBox includes a turn-key **IaaS** and **PaaS** cloud solution

* Can be used as a local cloud or as a **remote-controlled appliance**, or both

* Powered by SlipStream, **applications can be installed and configured remotely**, relieving the headache of frequent updates

* Entirely built out of **open source software**

* Control all your NuvlaBoxes from the same **dashboard**

* **Zero config** means it's a child's play to use

Watch this space!
