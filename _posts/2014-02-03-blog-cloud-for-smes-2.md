**Why should an SME transition to the cloud?**

We can’t leave Mr. Johnson hanging in the air now he has decided that the cloud is for him.  He wants to start making those **cost savings** but has no idea how to go about it, so what should he do and what pitfalls should he watch out for?  

Cloud does indeed seem to be an obvious choice for SMEs.  Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as it should be for smaller companies to have access to cloud resources, as you can read in a [previous blog](/blog/2014/01/20/blog-see-through-cloud-intro.html).  

I decided Mr Johnson would probably do an internet search, like we all do when we are looking for something, so I did the exactly that and I spent a very long time trying to come up with an answer for him. I tried many different search terms, and although it is true that there are hundreds of cloud providers out there, there doesn't seem to be anyone rushing forward to get the SME business. It's true that Eric Enormous Enterprise has huge wads of money, but [99%](http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/index_en.htm) of all European businesses are SMEs, so surely there is some money to be found there?

There are companies like [Epicor](http://www.epicor.com/Cloud/Pages/Cloud-Retail.aspx). Epicor provides cloud-based retail software with applications for point of sale, merchandising and audit, amongst other things.  It is a comprehensive offering, although a solution like this would mean that Mr Johnson has to change his current applications, which he may not want to do. 

There are the giants like SAP and Cisco, of course, but they can seem intimidating and the solutions inflexible (sorry guys).

Where are the individual software vendors who sell applications ideal for retailers everywhere? Why aren't they rushing forward for the business? Perhaps the answer is that they can't easily have their applications deployed in the cloud and need a deployment platform like [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) to make the job easier. 

Perhaps Mr Johnson should consider a solution like the [NuvlaBox](/products/nuvlabox.html)
