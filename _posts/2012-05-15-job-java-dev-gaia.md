Gaia is a European Space Agency ambitious mission to chart a three-dimensional map of our Galaxy, the Milky Way, in the process revealing the composition, formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Gaia will provide unprecedented positional and radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion stars in our Galaxy and throughout the Local Group. This amounts to about 1 per cent of the Galactic stellar population.

The selected candidate will be integrated in the Gaia mission team in Versoix, Switzerland. This team is responsible for the variability processing chain, one of the key scientific data exploitation part
