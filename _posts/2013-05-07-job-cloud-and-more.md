There is an opening with SixSq to join the Geneva team working on our core open source
cloud technologies
([SlipStreamâ„¢](/products/slipstream.html) and [StratusLab](/products/stratuslab.html)), as well
as special projects (e.g. cloud deployments, distributed systems, integration projects).

This position is of unlimited duration, once the initial probation period is passed.  The candidate must be a Swiss or European citizen, or have a valid Swiss working permit. For European citizens not currently holding a
Swiss work permit, SixSq will take care of the application, but the final employment is conditional to the granting of a work permit.

Note: Placement agencies, please do not apply as we require direct assignment.

We are currently looking at filling three positions, where the successful candidates will
have to have collectively fulfill the skills and experience listed below. Some skills
and experience are more important than others and we have tried to make this as clear as possible.  
We therefore do not expect you to fulfill of these requirements (that would be suspicious ;-))

If you have any questions on the opening, SixSq, the team, etc... [get in touch](mailto:jobs@sixsq.com?subject=job%20application).
