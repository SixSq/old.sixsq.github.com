Open-source IaaS cloud distribution. Turn your physical infrastructure
into a powerful IaaS cloud in minutes.

StratusLab is a European project partly funded by the European
Commission. SixSq is a founding member of the consortium.

SixSq, responsible within the StratusLab consortium for integration
and testing, has put significant effort to ensure that the
distribution can be installed and configured very quickly. In fact,
for simple deployments, system administrators can turn existing
physical infrastructures into IaaS cloud within minutes. The idea
being that simple things should be simple, this is why the StratusLab
distribution ships with sensible defaults, which will work in most of
the cases, at least to start with.  For simple deployments, system
administrators can turn existing physical infrastructures into IaaS
cloud within minutes.

With the release of version 1.0, the fully open-source StratusLab
distribution now offers a complete solution for creating and managing
cloud-based infrastructures.  It integrates the OpenNebula virtual
infrastructure manager with tools such as the Claudia platform service
management toolkit for dynamic service provisioning and scalability; a
Marketplace allowing scientific user communities to create, search for
and share customised digitally-signed virtual machine images;
persistent storage allowing users to create and access disks on remote
cloud storage resources; a web monitoring tool, and a comprehensive
set of easy-to-use command-line tools for system administrators and
users.
