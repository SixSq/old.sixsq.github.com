SixSq is currently recruiting a *Clojure and Cloud Developer*. As part of the SixSq core development team, the work will
consist in further developing [SlipStream](/products/slipstream), an open source multi-cloud management solution.  The successful candidate will work in extending the product, using primarily the Clojure language and its eco-system.  Since SlipStream still has Java elements, porting and reimplementation of Java logic into Clojure will also take place initially.

SlipStream is the foundation technology for SixSq's [Nuvla service](/services/nuvla) and [NuvlaBox product](/products/nuvlabox).

The developer will be involved in R&D projects, both in Europe and Switzerland. He/She will also be involved in the
development roadmap of the SixSq products and services.  Since each member of the team contributes to the support service,
the successful candidate will be interfacing with customers and users, thus building handson knowledge.
  
Since SixSq operates as a start-up and follows the kanban agile methodology and elements of devops, the successful candidate must have demonstrated experience and appetit for operating in this mode.

The successful candidate must be able to strive in a start-up environment and a flat hierarchy.

The selected candidate will be located in Geneva, as part of the SixSq core team.  Home working one day per week is possible but
the candidate must be within daily commute distance from the Geneva office.

The position is an unlimited assignment and can only be via a direct Swiss employment contract.

The candidate must be a Swiss or European citizen or have a valid Swiss working permit. 

**Note: Placement agencies, please do not apply as we require direct assignment.**

The selected candidate would ideally start early 2017.

The selected candidate will receive intensive training on the core technologies of SixSq, as well as R&D projects
currently running or about to kickoff.

Regular travels in Europe for short meetings should be expected.

The employment contract includes a standard package - e.g. 5 weeks holiday (plus public holiday), free public transport,
private laptop.
