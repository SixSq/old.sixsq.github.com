**A new blog series to demystify cloud**

In the role of Operations Manager in our organisation I have to wear many hats, but as I don't have a background in software or anything technical for that matter, I was unable to fully contribute to communicating the SixSq offer.  This has forced me up a very steep learning curve and has also led me to put pen to paper, or rather fingers to keyboard, to share my journey through the cloudscape.

Until recently, I've wisely nodded my head when listening to the details of what our products and services do, not wanting to be the fool who asked the silly question thereby revealing I actually had only a very basic understanding (when in fact the only foolish thing you can ever do is not ask the question) and have managed to stumble along until now. 

But no more.  In order to help our customers appreciate our strengths, I decided I had to improve my own understanding, so I asked our software developers to explain about cloud, [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) etc.  Their replies were along the lines of, “ application deployment automation”, “capacity to provision complex applications on multi-cloud”, “IaaS cloud distribution”....STOP! Can someone please switch on my geek-speak universal translator?  Well done to those of you who understand all that, but for the benefit of those who, like me, are still in the dark, I persisted.  To get to the bottom of it all, I drove everyone crazy with my three-year old style “but why?” “what for?” “but what does it DO?” questions. I'm finally getting to the bottom of it all (possibly...) and you know what: cloud – it's just computer power, like that big, old brick you used to have under your desk.  **So what is all the fuss about? The brilliant thing is that it's cheaper, more flexible and many, many times more powerful than any box you could fit into your office. It's also more secure, as your data is backed up off-site and managed by professionals.**

This is great news for *Eric Enormous Enterprise*, who has a huge IT department at his disposal and so can employ someone with knowledge in the field to make the most of this new development.  **But why don't *Sally SME* or *Joe Public* do the same?  Surveys show that only 1 in 4 organisations use cloud resources, so if it is such a cost saver, why such a small percentage?**

The answer is that access to cloud resources via, for example, Amazon Web Services, is still pretty complex.  You still need a high level of technical knowledge to  configure your own machine and add whatever bells and whistles needed to carry out your specific task.  This is like going to a restaurant and being asked to go into the kitchen, pick out the ingredients and make your own meal. It seems restaurants and take aways have not yet been invented in the cloudscape.  Most small businesses don't get past the first hurdle and have to turn to IT service providers, the five star chefs, to sort it out.  This is, however, expensive, can be inflexible and doesn't always provide the expected results.  Wouldn't it be great to have an Apple-style app store which makes it easy to find and assess the applications an organisation wants? The cloud restaurant with a user-friendly waiter isn’t there – yet.  My understanding, however, is that [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) is the first step towards this app market place as it's *a multi-cloud coordinated provisioning and image factory engine.* Oh, we're back to gobbledy-geek again.  In other words, it allows you to automatically (no extra work for the user) deploy a software application in a cloud.  And that can be in any cloud you choose and with any application you need to run your business. 

So that's where my knowledge stands at the beginning of 2014 and one of my resolutions is to keep learning and and try to expand my understanding.  Let's hope it doesn't go the same way as the perennial resolution to lose those post-Christmas kilos.  Maybe I'll use this blog as a Weight Watchers-style encouragement.  If I know I have to post my success (or failure) it will keep me on track.
