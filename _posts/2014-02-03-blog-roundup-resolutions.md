**NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS - START 2014 THE RIGHT WAY!**

**Number 1: Get fit for cloud**

Make sure you fully understand the advantages cloud can bring your organisation. The web is full of independent information explaining this.

For example: 
http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cloud_computing.html

Don't let the cost-saving advantages of cloud pass you by.

**Number 2: Take a trip**

Visit SixSq at the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February 2014. http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/
The world's largest conference for the mobile industry, covering all that is cool and new in the world of mobile.  Exhibitors include mobile operators, device manufacturers, technology providers, vendors and content owners from across the world.  74,000 attendees in 2013 can't be wrong. And it's taking place in a beautiful city, worth the visit in itself.

And why is SixSq exhibiting there?  We have been selected to be part of the Swiss Pavilion with 19 other Swiss SMEs, showcasing our mobile related innovations.  

We will be launching the “Smallest and Smartest Cloud” product ever.  Check out the NuvlaBox http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox.html

**Number 3: Automate boring tasks**

Drastically reduce time to market by reducing the time taken to deploy applications. This applies to build and test deployments, but also certification and production.

Customers have witnessed reductions in deployment time from days to minutes, providing positive ROI within a single quarter.

**Number 4: Stop worrying whether you made the right choice of cloud provider**

What matters is how you use the cloud and what you do with it.  So make sure you choose the right management tools to ensure you remain cloud neutral.  And yes, SixSq can help. 

**Number 5: Virtualise, don’t cloudify**

Businesses often deploy virtual machines haphazardly, losing the opportunity to truly manage their service infrastructure, which is where true cost savings can be made. Automate your processes and make sure you put the right tracking tools in place.
 
**Number 6: Go Green**

Move to cloud computing. We all know that the use of electrical gadgets is a disaster for the environment, but a 2010 report from Pike Research predicted that cloud computing could cut global data-centre energy use by 38% by 2020. http://www.navigantresearch.com/research/green-data-centers


**Number 7: Lose weight**

If your organisation is operating many different machines to run its applications, watch out for the NuvlaBox by SixSq, the smallest, lightest and smartest cloud appliance around.  A fan-less PC that can run many applications simultaneously, be updated remotely and is entirely built from open source software.  Cool!
