As the **Swiss cloud experts**, SixSq can provide you with no nonsense software development consultancy and services, in a flexible and adaptive manner. 

We build flexibility into all of our contracts, to ensure our
customers get what they want from us.


Cloud Strategy and Migration Consultancy
==============================

SixSq is a recognised leader in the field of cloud. This includes a thorough understanding of different
cloud solutions and covers public, private and hybrid clouds
and a number of key usage patterns, as well as integration and migration strategies.

If you find yourself challenged in your cloud strategy and need independent advice and/or validation,
SixSq will help you:

 * find your way through the cloud maze, 
 * make sense of this very powerful technology,
 * find the processes that will yield maximum return on investment,
 * start your migration strategy towards early wins and long lasting returns


Process Automation Consultancy
==============================

Many companies struggle with error-prone, complicated deployments and engineers spend their time validating manual deployment processes instead of developing software. Automated deployment can solve those problems and save your business time and money.
Using [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) as part of your process automation strategy is straightforward.  Its full benefit comes into play when integrated into the overall product and/or service chain of its users.

We provide consultancy in the form of simple and practical advice, as well as recipes (i.e. installation,
configuration and coordination), to accelerate the implementation of process automation into existing or new  infrastructure and tools.

A standard process automation pattern is a **DevOps style delivery pipeline**.  SixSq can help customers
put this pipeline in place, using tooling (such as SlipStream) and agile processes.


Custom Software Development
==============================

SixSq shares its knowledge in building distributed software systems via special projects. We integrate
RESTful web service design and technology, coupled with distributed messaging and NoSQL solutions to
build scalable, streamlined and no single point-failure architecture and solutions.

We love challenges, so please share yours with us, we will be thrilled to team up so that 
we can find solutions and implement them together.


Agile Software Development
==========================

SixSq provides agile software development services and consultancy, focused
on Scrum and eXtreme Programming (XP) practices such as Test Driven Development
(TDD) and Continuous Integration and Delivery techniques.

Our two-day introduction course mixes theory and practice, in a ludic atmosphere,
giving participants a real feel of the amazing potential, as well as the pitfalls, of Scrum.

Our coaching service allows teams to be coached before, during and after key events, such as Planning Meetings, Demo Meetings and Retrospectives.
Specific focus is also put on the quality of the Product Backlog, key to
a successful implementation of Scrum.
