flexible and adaptive manner.

More specifically, we offers consultancy, training and coaching, on agile software development
techniques, SlipStream™ and cloud migration and integration.


Process Automation Consultancy
------------------------------

Using [SlipStream™](/products/slipstream.html) is straightforward, however we can help customers take
maximum advantage of our technology with simple and practical advice.

The integration of such technology in existing or new engineering infrastructure 
and tools is also a field where SixSq can offer great benefit.


Agile Software Development
--------------------------

SixSq provides agile software development services and consultancy, focused
on Scrum and eXtreme Programming (XP) practices such as Test Driven Development
(TDD) and Continuous Integration and Delivery techniques.
We build flexibility and change into all or our contracts, to ensure our
customers get what they want from us.

Our two-day introduction course, mixes theory and practices, in a ludic atmosphere,
such that participants leave with a real feel for what Scrum is, its amazing
potential as well as its pitfalls.

Our coaching service allows teams to be coached before, during and after
real key events, such as Planning Meetings, Demo Meetings and Retrospectives.
Specific focus is also put on the quality of the Product Backlog, key to
a successful implementation of Scrum.
