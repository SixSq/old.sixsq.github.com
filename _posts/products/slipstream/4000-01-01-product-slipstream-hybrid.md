                <h2>What is Hybrid Cloud?</h2>
                <p>DevOps brings together IT operations and software development. Traditionally, these two departments work alongside each other but not together, causing inefficiences and often friction. DevOps brings a collaborative way of working and organising which stresses communication and sharing. While once a geeky concept, it is now recognised by C-level executives as a powerful set of best practices and concepts that can yield
                significant benefits for enterprises embracing it.

                <h2>Where Does SlipStream Fit In?</h2>
                <p>DevOps is first of all an attitude of mind, but one which is much improved by the use of
                good tools and technologies. Cloud and container technologies and services have recently opened             
                new doors
                to allow the implemention of DevOps in the enterprise. SlipStream is one such technology.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                It enables a new
                level of automation, which is the real benefit DevOps brings to any organisation. Adding the
                right automation on top of an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), such as an open
                <a href="/products/slipstream/paas">PaaS</a>
                framework, makes DevOps a game changer and can reduce time to market and improve your   
                organisation's ability to push innovation faster.

                <h2>What are the benefits of Hybrid Cloud?</h2>
                <p>Adopting DevOps will give your organisation more time to innovate! By
                reducing the number of manual tasks required to build development, testing, certification and
                production environments, you keep your team focused on adding value to your customers, by
                spending more time designing new features and smoothing out bugs.
                </p>
                <p>And since you create a constant dialogue between operations and development functions or
                teams, you create software and services that are easier to operate, troubleshoot, upgrade and
                maintain.

                <h2>DevOps is all about Communication and Smart Sharing</h2>
                <p>How often do your teams re-invent the wheel? What if each time a team was able to configure
                a piece of software, this knowledge was then available to all other teams? What if you could let 
                teams deploy quality assured software systems directly into production, with no security 
                compromise? SlipStream makes this possible thanks to smart automation on private, public and/or
                <a href="/products/slipstream/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a>.
                </p>
                <p>You can also assemble applications from parts, like with Lego bricks, 
                simply reusing standard and legacy components.  It's like if each DevOps team had access
                to the entire knowledge base of your organisation, in an executable form, via a web ui
                or an API call.
