                <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
                <p>DevOps is  a bringing together of IT operations, i.e. the people and management processes         associated with IT service management, and software development, i.e. the actual programming, documenting and testing involved in creating a software product. In many cases, these two departments work alongside each other but not together, causing inefficiences and often friction. DevOps brings a new way of working and organising which stresses communication and collaboration. While once a geeky concept, it is now recognised as a powerful set of best practices and concepts that can yield
                significant benefits for enterprises embracing it.

                <h2>Where Does SlipStream Fit In?</h2>
                <p>DevOps is first of all an attitude of mind, but one which is much improved by the use of good tools. Cloud and container technologies and services have recently opened new doors
                to allow the implemention of DevOps in the enterprise. SlipStream is one such tool</p>
                </p>
                It enables a new
                level of automation, which is the real benefit DevOps brings to the organisation. Adding the
                right automation on top of an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), such as an open <a href="/products/slipstream/paas">PaaS</a>
                framework, makes DevOps a game changer and can reduce time to market and improve your   
                organisation's ability to push more innovation faster.

                <h2>More Time to Innovate</h2>
                <p>So implementing DevOps will give my organisation more time to innovate? Absolutely! By
                reducing the number of manual tasks required to build development, testing, certification and
                production environments, you keep your team focused on adding value to your customers, by
                spending more time designing new features and smoothing out bugs.
                </p>
                <p>And since you create a constant dialogue between operations and development functions or
                teams, you create software services that are easier to operate, troubleshoot, upgrade and
                maintain.

                <h2>Share and Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
                <p>How often do your teams re-invent the wheel? What if each time a team was able to configure
                a piece of software, it was available to all others to leverage? What if you could let teams
                deploy quality assured software systems directly in production, with no security compromise?
                This is all possible thanks to smart automation on private, public and <a href="/products/slipstream/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a>.

                <p>Futher, you can also assemble applications from parts, like with Lego bricks, simply
                reusing standard and your own legacy components.
