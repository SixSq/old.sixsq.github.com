                <h2>What is DevOps?</h2>
                <p>In a nutshell, DevOps is the fruitful meshing of the agile methodology and lean principal to include deployment, operation and maintenance of software systems</strong>. While once a geeky
                concept, it is now recognised as a powerful set of best practices and concepts that can yield
                significant benefits for enterprises embracing it. Therefore, <strong>DevOps is now a common 
                term used by CIOs, COOs, CTOs and even CEOs</strong>. While tooling has being around to support 
                this fluid movement, cloud and container technologies and services has recently open new doors
                and implement DevOps in the enterprise.

                <h2>Cloud: the perfect DevOps companion</h2>
                <p>Like most popular new ideas, the IT and software industry is now flooding the news with   
                magical tools and solutions. From configuration management tools, Ã  la Puppet, Chef, Ansible or Salt,
                to continuous integration services such as Jenkins, or even local tools like Vagrant. The latest contender is Docker, with interesting promises, but this is often adding confusion.
                </p>
                <p>However, the cloud itself is one of the most profound DevOps enablers. It enables a new
                level of automation, which is the real benefit DevOps brings to the organisation. Adding the
                right automation on top of IaaS, such as an open <a href="/products/slipstream/paas">PaaS</a>
                framework, makes DevOps a game changer and can reduce time to market and improve your   
                organisation's ability to push more innovation faster.

                <h2>More Time to Innovate</h2>
                <p>So implementing DevOps will give my organisation more time to innovate? Absolutely! By
                reducing the number of manual tasks required to build development, testing, certification and
                production environments, you keep your team focused on adding value to your customers, by
                spending more time designing new features and smoothing out bugs.
                </p>
                <p>And since you create a constant dialogue between operations and development functions or
                teams, you create software services that are easier to operate, troubleshoot, upgrade and
                maintain.

                <p>How often do your teams re-invent the wheel? What if each time a team was able to configure
                a piece of software, it was available to all others to leverage? What if you could let teams
                deploy quality assured software systems directly in production, with no security compromise?
                This is all possible thanks to smart automation on private, public and <a href="/products/slipstream/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a>.

                reusing standard and your own legacy components.
