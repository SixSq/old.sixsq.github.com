                <h2>What is PaaS?</h2>
                <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is cloud service model which provides a ready-made programming environment and cloud infrastructure for the programmer. This relieves him or her from having to construct those services from scratch in the application. Typically the end customer is an application developer who uses the service to automate his or her application deployment. PaaS is to the IT industry what the assembly line is to manufacturing, but thankfully without the boring bits.  It brings optimisation, standardisation, uniformity and interchangeability.

                <h2>Automate Application Deployment</h2>
                <p>Repetitive, manual deployments are costing your organisation money. Introducing automation will reduce expenditure and give your people more time to create greater things. To our knowledge, no other solution provides the same level of application deployment automation capabilities, which work for new and legacy applications alike.</p>

                <h2>Streamline Your Processes with Self-Service IT</h2>
                <p>Provisioning applications inside an organisation should be as simple as installing an app on a mobile device. Too often, the enterprise process for deploying an application triggers a chain reaction of hardware and software procurement processes that can take weeks, if not months, reducing flexibility and increasing costs. SlipStream lets users focus on their business objectives by allowing them to deploy applications from an enterprise App Store. No more worries about cloud configurations, security settings, application deployment and configuration parameters. Users pick curated applications from a clear list, fill a few high-level parameters and SlipStream takes care of delivering the applications in minutes.</p>
