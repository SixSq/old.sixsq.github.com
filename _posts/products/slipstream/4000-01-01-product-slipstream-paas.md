                <h2>What is PaaS?</h2>
                <p>Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud service model which provides a ready-made programming
                environment and cloud infrastructure for the developer. This relieves him or her from having to
                construct those services from scratch in the application. Typically the end customer is an
                application developer who uses the service to automate his or her application deployment. 
                </p>
                <p>PaaS is to the IT industry what the robotic assembly line is to manufacturing, but thankfully
                without the need for ear plugs.  It brings optimisation, standardisation, uniformity and
                interchangeability. To read more about cloud service models and other cloud jargon, check

                <h2>Where Does SlipStream Fit In?</h2>
                <p>SlipStream is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution, supporting all major cloud, i.e.
                <a href="http://media.sixsq.com/blog/tackling-cloud-jargon">IaaS</a>, solutions. SlipStream
                provides a simple yet flexible and powerful framework which signifcantly decreases organisational costs when
                compared to traditional application development and deployment models.
                </p>
                <p>The level of automation SlipStream delivers provides impressive return on investment (ROI).
                As a result, SlipStream saves considerable amounts of engineering time, since application
                deployments are less error-prone and much more repeatable, allowing developers and engineers
                to test and release more frequently, reducing time-to-market and overheads.

                <h2>What are the Benefits of PaaS?</h2>
                <p>Reduce costs, speed up innovation, maximise uptime and strengthen security. These are just a few of the advantages PaaS brings. PaaS is the robotic assembly line of software, as it delivers automation of application deployment to a level never achieved before. To our knowledge, no solution other than SlipStream provides the same level of application deployment automation. And it works for new and legacy
                applications alike. Our users report a <strong>saving of 8 hours per deployment</strong>.</p>
                <p>And if your application architecture supports it, SlipStream's horizontal and vertical
                scaling features will help you ensure that you scale with demand, another way to minimise
                costs.</p>
