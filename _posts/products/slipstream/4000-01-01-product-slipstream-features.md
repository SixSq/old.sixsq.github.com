Features
========

Here are more technical details on the key SlipStream features:

* **Multi-machine Provisioning System**: SlipStream allows users to define and execute deployments, based on high-level recipes, independently of the cloud on which the recipes will be applied.  Deployments include coordination and orchestration of virtual machines, including ordering and synchronisation of services. 

  For example, users can deploy, in a single action, on-demand, entire multi-tier software systems. With SlipStream, this operation takes a few minutes, often compared to hours if not days using custom solutions. 

* **Multi-cloud Provisioning**: SlipStream supports multi-cloud deployments. This means users have the choice of a number of cloud service providers and technologies (public and/or private) when deploying virtual machines, from within the same SlipStream service. Furthermore, users can choose to deploy different parts of a deployment on different cloud services or regions, such that redundant and resilient behaviour is reached.  SlipStream supports different clouds using a connector design.  The available connectors are listed [here](/products/slipstream/cloud-connectors.html).

  To illustrate, users can deploy applications (e.g. computing clusters, load balanced applications, multi-media processing pipelines) across several cloud providers, in order to improve data proximity & resilience, while reducing costs.

* **Support continuous integration processes with continuous deployment**: SlipStream encourages users to parameterise image creation and deployment recipes, so that key parameters (e.g. software version, package location, dependencies, inter-relationships) can be provided at runtime. This means that it is easy to integrate SlipStream with continuous integration servers to provide a full deployment chain. 
	
  For instance, users can provision complete server-side systems in a single action in order to test and certify a specific version of the system.

* **Independence from specific IaaS interfaces and hypervisors**: the SlipStream recipes are independent of specific IaaS interfaces, therefore avoiding vendor lock-in, allowing you to focus on configuration and deployment, instead of the specifics of each IaaS. 

  For example, users can seamlessly apply the same image construction recipes and multi-machine deployments to different cloud providers, yielding the same results every time.

* **Community sharing platform**: the SlipStream data model permits users to decide to share their image and deployment recipes with other users, thus contributing to a community effort, an important aspect of agile and DevOps principles.
