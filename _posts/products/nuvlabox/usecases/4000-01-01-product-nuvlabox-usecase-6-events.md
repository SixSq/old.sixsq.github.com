In our ever-connected world, company presence at large fairs or events requires an IT presence. This potentially means:

1. video stream setup
2. application demonstrations
3. multi-screen organisations
4. etc

This is made difficult as network access is often at a premium at large fairs, and is usually tied with bandwidth restrictions. This calls for the compact, local IT infrastructure, able to work in autonomous mode, which the NuvlaBox provides. In addition, its ability to deploy its own local Wi-Fi network can be used to link all devices reducing wiring and increasing mobility of people staffing the booth.

NuvlaBox is the perfect solution for such an event. Once the applications have been cached in the box, they can be deployed in 1-click. This means the box can be setup with all the necessary applications in minutes, freeing time to generate real business. If the NuvlaBox can be attached to a local network that has access to the WAN, then it can also be remote controlled by off-site IT experts, increasing flexibility.

Each application to be deployed on the box will require a recipe/blueprint, which takes the form of a few scripts and configuration. SixSq will be happy to help you with this task, via our professional *Recipe Creation Service*.

To remote control boxes, you will need a SlipStream instance. [SlipStream](/products/slipstream/) is the software piece that contains the intelligence including the multi NuvlaBox dashboard. While SixSq runs [SlipStream as a SaaS](/products/slipstream/tryme), you will most probably want to run your own version for this type of usage.

If you need deployment recipes or blueprints to automate application deployment, SixSq will also be happy to help you with this task, via our professional service. Just [get in touch](http://localhost:4000/contact/#contact-us-form).
