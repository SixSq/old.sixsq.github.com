Protection of goods, people and networks is becoming increasingly important and yet more challenging. Deploying the NuvlaBox as part of your security installation can help with the following:

- **Video surveillance**

The NuvlaBox is perfect for a situation which requires **local processing** of video streams, to avoid sending large amounts of high definition images on the network. Large unedited video streams are a cause for concern in terms of security, privacy and bandwidth. By processing the streams locally on a NuvlaBox, the customer can process all of the original content, and only send back the processed video stream to the main servers, hosted in a different location.

- **Access control**

Access control is a security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can physically enter a location AND who can view or use resources in a computing environment. Security workers can now be equipped with a device which automatically grants access to authorised areas and feeds back information to a central control unit. Tracking these devices is essential to ensure security of personnel, premises and goods. But what happens when connectivity drops or is tampered with? Using a NuvlaBox, you can be sure that personnel are always connected and protected.  

- **Protection and management of security personnel**

Protecting lone and isolated workers is of key importance.
