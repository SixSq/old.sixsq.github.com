More and more *intelligent* devices can be *connected*, contributing to the phenomenon known as Internet of Things or **IoT**. These applications bring both opportunities and challenges. The opportunity comes from being able to monitor more devices (e.g. home appliances, cameras, sensors of all sorts) and the ability to retrieve interesting data remotely. The challenge is in handling all this data, in a consistent and secure way.  For example, sensors play an important role in agriculture and forestry today, with the need to increase production and reduce costs, while keeping a close eye on environmental impact. The use of sensors helps to exploit all available resources appropriately and to apply hazardous products moderately. However, forwarding raw data from the sensors via broadband network is expensive and not always possible due to **scarce bandwidth**, lack of resources and **security** risks.  

The NuvlaBox solves that problem when used as a sensor aggregator.  If we connect the sensors to the box, either via WiFi or Ethernet, applications running in the box can act as an aggregator.  This aggregator can perform a number of things in the box itself:

1. Store raw data locally
2. Aggregate (e.g. reduce, post-process) the raw data into datasets that can be more readily used
3. Stream data (raw or aggregated) back home. This process can be setup such that it only takes place when external connectivity is available and detected
4. Allow remote control, when connected to the WAN, such that several locations can be monitored at once
