Users operating in the field, such as aid workers (e.g. relief efforts, aid camps) and journalists (e.g. sports events, international conferences, emergency coverage) require a local IT infrastructure.

During the launch of the NuvlaBox at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we met several journalists. Holding the NuvlaBox one of them said "I wish we'd had your NuvlaBox during the Sochi 2014 Olympics. Our local IT infrastructure took a long time to setup and was not brilliant". This illustrates that a platform which can be used by non-IT specialists to simply and securely deploy applications in a local IT infrastructure has enormous value. When combined with the ability to *call home* in a secure manner, as is required by journalists, for example, to deliver their material, such a platform can make a real difference.

With its App Store giving the ability to deploy applications with 1-click and its capacity to run up to 8 virtual servers locally, the NuvlaBox is an ideal solution. Indeed, once the NuvlaBox has been loaded with the right base images, the App Store can deploy applications autonomously (i.e. without needing network access) to support field operators. Furthermore, since field operators can deploy applications themselves, significant cost savings can be made by letting technical staff focus on more complex tasks and support.

In the context of aid work, the NuvlaBox has its own Wi-Fi capabilities, which can be used to disseminate important information to other aid workers and civilians alike within a secure network.

If an external network is available - e.g. via satellite link - even for short period of times, the NuvlaBox can then *call home* to allow it to be remotely accessed. This allows off-site IT experts not only to monitor the box, but also to automatically update image recipes and blueprints, perform maintenance tasks and backup important data.
