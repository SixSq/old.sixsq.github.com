**Why contributing?**

Maybe you had a dream about a new, cool and exciting feature that SlipStream should have, maybe you want to use SlipStream with a Cloud which is not on the “List of supported Clouds” or you simply found a bug. All these reasons may lead you to contribute to SlipStream.


**How to contribute?**

Depending on your level/skill in computer sciences you have different ways to contribute.


***As a standard computer user***

You can go on GitHub ([https://github.com/slipstream/](https://github.com/slipstream/)) and add an issue to the corresponding repository. Please tag your issue with a relevant label.
If you are not comfortable with the GitHub website you can send a mail to [support@sixsq.com](mailto:support@sixsq.com), call the support number [+41 22 57 52 229](tel:0041225752229) or call our Skype support account [sixsq.support](callto:sixsq.support).
In the near future we will add a tool like UserVoice where you will be able to ask for new features and vote for them. This tool will also enable you to easily give your opinion about SlipStream.


***As a developer or user with development skills***

You can contribute to SlipStream by improving the code by yourself.
If the change you want to do is very small (~1-4 lines of code in the same file) you can edit the file directly on GitHub. 
When you will save the file, GitHub will fork the repository in your account and save the file in this newly created repository. 
After that, you can create a pull request (still on the GitHub website).
If your modifications are more consequent, you have to fork the corresponding repository (you can do that on the GitHub website) and get a local development version of SlipStream to test your modifications.

All of the steps to get a working development environment are detailed in the [administrator manual](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamDocumentation/tree/master/docs/administrator-manual/src/main/markdown). 

These steps can be summarized as follow:
1.  Fork (on GitHub) the repositories you want to contribute to. [https://github.com/slipstream/](https://github.com/slipstream/)
2.  Install prerequisites (Git, Maven, Hsqldb, Eclipse<sup>[1](#note1)</sup> , …). [Administrator Manual - 2 Prerequisites](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamDocumentation/blob/master/docs/administrator-manual/src/main/markdown/02-prerequisites.md)
3.  Clone on your machine (with Git) the forked repositories. [Administrator Manual - 3 Building - Checkout sources](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamDocumentation/blob/master/docs/administrator-manual/src/main/markdown/03-building.md#checkout-sources)
4.  Clone other base repositories from SlipStream repositories ([SlipStreamParent](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamParent), [SlipStreamServer](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamServer), [SlipStreamClient](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamClient), [SlipStreamServerDeps](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamServerDeps), […](https://github.com/slipstream/)).
5.  Modify the source code of the forked repositories.
6.  Compile, run unittest, generate JAR and RPM by running `mvn clean install` inside the directories corresponding to the forked repositories. [Administrator Manual - 3 Building - Build and package](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamDocumentation/blob/master/docs/administrator-manual/src/main/markdown/03-building.md#build-and-package)
7.  Run SlipStream to test your modifications on a real environment. You have two ways to do that:
    1. Run a local hsqldb server and run a local SlipStream server. [SlipStreamParent - Readme](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamParent/blob/master/README.md)
    2. Use RPMs generated by `mvn clean install` to install SlipStream with yum by creating a local yum repository. [Administrator Manual - 3 Building - Create local yum repository](https://github.com/slipstream/SlipStreamDocumentation/blob/master/docs/administrator-manual/src/main/markdown/03-building.md#create-local-yum-repository)
        1. Create a directory called `repo`.
        2. Copy all RPMs found in repositories subdirectory like this one: `rpm/target/rpm/slipstream-server-el6/RPMS/*.rpm` into the directory called “repo”.
        3. Then create a local yum repository with: `createrepo repo` and add it to your yum configuration `vi /etc/yum.repo.d/local`
        4. Install SlipStream with the yum command. E.g.: `yum install slipstream-server`

<sup id="note1">1</sup> Using Eclipse is recommended but not mandatory. If you want to use Eclipse you can import Maven projects by clicking on: `File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project`.


***Note on Connectors development***

Developing a connector can take time if you are not accustomed to the connector development process. The SixSq team is very efficient in this task so it can be more profitable for you to ask for a quote and let the SixSq team develop the connector for you.
