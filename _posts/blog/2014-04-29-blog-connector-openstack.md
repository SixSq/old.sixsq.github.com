**How to configure the SlipStream OpenStack Connector**

Here are instructions on how to configure the SlipStream OpenStack connector.
This connector is already included inside SlipStream there is no extra package to install.

Prerequisite
----

This installation recipe assumes that you have already installed the SlipStream server on the same
server. For details
on how to install the server, please refer to the 
[online documentation](https://slipstream.sixsq.com/html/administrator-manual.html).

Load the connector in SlipStream
----

Once the connector software is installed, you can configure SlipStream to load this connector
by either setting the parameter in the configuration file (i.e. `/etc/slipstream/slipstream.conf`)
or via the web interface.


**Configuration file**

The list of connector instances SlipStream uses is defined by the `cloud.connector.class` configuration
parameter:

	# cat /etc/slipstream/slipstream.conf
	# SlipStream(tm) Server configuration file
	slipstream.registration.enable = true

	cloud.connector.class = com.sixsq.slipstream.connector.openstack.OpenStackConnector
	
	...

By default, the connector instance will be named *openstack*. You can change the name of the
connector by prepending the name followed by a semi colon (i.e. `:`). Here is an example:

	cloud.connector.class = my-openstack:com.sixsq.slipstream.connector.openstack.OpenStackConnector

You can also instantiate several times the connector by
comma separating the connector string. Here is an example:

	cloud.connector.class = my-openstack-1:com.sixsq.slip...openstack.OpenStackConnector, my-openstack-2:com.sixsq...

Once the configuration file is set, login to SlipStream as a privileged user and load the configuration. The configuration
page is available by clicking on the spanner icon at the top right of the screen. To load the changes made in the configuration
file, simply click on the `Reload Configuration File` button.  You should then see the changed value in the
*SlipStream Basics* section.


**Configuration page**

You can also define which connector to load, as per the Configuration file section above, using the web user
interface.  Once logged-in with a privileged user (e.g. *super*), open the configuration page by clicking on the
spanner icon at the top right of the screen.  Then open the *SlipStream Basics* section and drop in the
value of the configuration, as per described in the section above. Here is a screenshot of the parameter to
define:

Don't forget to save the configuration!

Now that the connector is loaded, you need to configure it.


**Super/privileged user**

By default, SlipStream configures a privileged user called *super*, with the default password `supeRsupeR`.
Please make sure you change this default password.


Configure the connector instance in SlipStream
----

Once the connector is loaded, you need to configure the connector.  While you can also define these parameters
using the configuration file, we only show here how to do it using the web user interface.

With the connector loaded in SlipStream, a new section in the configuration page will appear, allowing
you to configure how the connector is to communicate with the IaaS cloud endpoint.

**Type name of the service who provide the instances functionality**

This field should always be `compute`.
If it doesn't work with this value, please ask your OpenStack provider/administrator for the correct value.


**Service endpoint**

The service endpoint is the URL SlipStream will use to communicate with the OpenStack.
This url need to match the OpenStack identity service (Keystone).
You can find it in the OpenStack dashboard under *Access & Security* in the tab *API Access*.
Most of time this value match the following pattern: `https://OpenStack_ip:5000/v2.0`

<p align="center"><img src="/img/content/blogs/doc_OpenStack_endpoint.png" alt="Openstack web interface - Access & Security - API Access" class="shadow"  width="750" /></p>

**Quota**

The quota is an internal feature of SlipStream which enable the SlipStream administrator to set a global quota for all users of a specified connector.
You can also override this value per user in the user profile.
If this feature is disabled in SlipStream you can leave this field blank.


**Image Id of the Orchestrator**

The image id of the Orchestrator needs to match a Linux image with `wget` and `python` installed.
An Ubuntu 12.04 will do the job perfectly.

To find an image id go on the OpenStack web interface and click on the link named *Images & Snapshots* and then click on the image you want then copy&paste the id.

**Region**

The OpenStack region. 
You have to look into the documentation provided by your OpenStack provider/administrator or ask him.
The default region is `RegionOne` or `regionOne` depending of the OpenStack version.


**Name of the service who provide the instances functionality**

Most of time the value this filed is `nova` and sometime `compute`
If it doesn't work with this value, please ask your OpenStack provider/administrator for the correct value.


**Flavor of the Orchestrator**

The flavor (instance type) is a name which is linked to an hardware specification defined by the Cloud.
To find the list of all possible values, please go on the OpenStack web interface and find a link called *Flavor* or *Instance type*.
The Orchestrator don't need a big amount of ressources so you can choose a small flavor (like 1 CPU and 512 MB of RAM).


Configure native images for this connector instance
----

Now you need to update SlipStream base images to add the image id and some parameters for OpenStack.

Please go on a SlipStream base image (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04) and click on the `Edit` button.
Add the image id for OpenStack in the section named *Cloud Image Identifiers and Image Hierarchy*.

And then configure the default flavor and the default security groups list on the tab *OpenStack* of the section *Cloud Configuration*.

User credentials
----

The last step is to tell to your users to configure their credentials for OpenStack in their user profile.
