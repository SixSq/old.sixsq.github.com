**How to configure the SlipStream VMWare vCloud Connector**

Here are instructions on how to configure the SlipStream VMWare vCloud connector.  This connector
is distributed by SixSq under a commercial license and is available for sale.

With each commercial connector purchase, SixSq will provide you with a specific yum configuration.
Once your yum configuration is in place you can install the connector executing the following command:

	yum install slipstream-connector-vcloud 
	asdasd asdasda
		asdasd asdas
	asdasd
	

Once the connector software is installed, you can configure SlipStream to load this connector
by either setting the parameter in the configuration file (i.e. `/etc/slipstream/slipstream.conf`)
or via the web interface.
