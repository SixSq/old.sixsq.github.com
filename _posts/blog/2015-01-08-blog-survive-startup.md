**HOW TO SURVIVE 7 YEARS BOOTSTRAPPING A START UP**
------

Amazingly, here we are, seven years after founding SixSq, not just chugging along but steadily growing and finding our own space in the cloud market. This is a great achievement, given that 60% of IT startups fail within the first 4 years. It’s been an interesting roller coaster ride. I’ve been reflecting recently on all the ups and downs and what/who has helped me to get this far without going completely crazy. Here are the things which spring immediately to mind.

1.	**Make use of the local and national resources available to small businesses**. I’ve discovered some great organisations here in Geneva and I’ve not doubt there will be some equivalents near you.  I work a lot with the fabulous FER [Federation des Entreprises Romandes](https://www.fer-ge.ch/web/fer-ge), which offers a great, reasonably priced online salary system, as well as free training to members on a wide range of employment issues. They send us updates on changes to social security, employment law and so on, so I don’t have to worry if I’m missing something, which was a concern for me initially, being non-Swiss.  [AlpICT](http://www.alpict.com/en/), acts as a hub for ICT companies in western Switzerland, has been a great source of networking and expertise. Check out if there is an Economic Development Office in your city or county as they will help you establish your business and give advice national and international activities, as the “[Service de la promotion économique]”(https://ge.ch/ecoguichetpmepmi/content/qui-sommes-nous) does in Geneva.

2.	**Get a good relationship with your bank**….but don’t expect them to help when times are tough. Know for sure that you will lay awake at 3am worrying about cash flow, as, although it’s an ancient cliché, cash flow is most certainly king and has been the death of many small companies. I’ve never engaged in expenditure without knowing were the money would come from to cover it, but have nevertheless had my fingers burned by long-winded processes for purchase orders, overdue payments etc. And getting a credit line from the bank these days, unless you already have a few million lying around, is incredibly difficult. 

3.	**Beware of the sharks!** Although some of them are friendly. You remember Nemo, right? After a period of time, you will be swamped with offers from SEO, website and branding experts, PR agencies, analysts, all telling you they can turn your company into a huge success. There is a lot to be said for all of those services, but don’t be pushed or rushed into a decision, do your homework and comparisons and only commit when you can see the return on investment for your company…not theirs. 

4.	**Recognise how hard your team works.** You may need/want/love to work evenings, weekends and holidays, as your heart and soul are in this thing, but you can’t expect the rest of the team to do so.  The SixSq team has been so dedicated and hard-working and we couldn’t have got this far without them, but I know we don’t say it often enough.  Guys, you’re amazing.  Thanks for sticking with us. 

5.	You must choose, but choose wisely. For the sake of your health, marriage/partnership and generally mental wellbeing, you will at some point have to consider getting into bed with an investor, venture capitalist, or financial partner of some description. This will, and should be, a long process of getting to know each other, and you need to be happy you are not giving up your dream and road map. Do they just want to generate a big profit and run away?  This maybe OK for you, but check all the small print of the Sale and/or Shareholder Agreement so you won’t be left with a nasty surprise later in the relationship.  Or are they interested in your core business and want to help you move forward? If so, make sure you can still influence the decision process and enjoy seeing your baby grow. 

6.	**Try to keep perspective.** Even if it all goes pear-shaped, you will have achieved something that most people don’t have the courage to even attempt. You had the vision, drive and organisation to set up a business and kept it running, even if only for a short time, and that experience is laudable and valuable.  Take what you have learnt and use It positively in your next adventure.
