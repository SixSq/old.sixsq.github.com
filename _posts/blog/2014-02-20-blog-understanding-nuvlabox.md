**What is all the excitement about here at SixSq?**

During the last couple of weeks, among other things, I've been climbing the learning curve to the pinnacle of **NuvlaBox** understanding. I only needed stiff boots this time, whereas for [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html), it was crampons, ropes and ice axes all the way. Does this  mean that the NuvlaBox is easier to understand? Let's see what you think.

It is an appliance, a box about the size of a modem, so it's something I can literally hold in my hand, which helps with my understanding. And it's a beautiful object. I can plug it in and switch it on and it automatically creates its own Wi-Fi network. Cool! I can see the advantage of that, especially if I'm somewhere the network is non-existent or unreliable, and now with my iPad I can connect to it and create a user account with SlipStream. Now what do I do with it?  

Well, everyone in the family has a different favourite use for it, but let's look first at the everyday commercial use. 

If I have a business running several servers, I can use the NuvlaBox as a local cloud, as it can host up to 8 virtual machines, meaning that I can **replace 8 of the servers** I currently run.  For example, it's common to have one server running linux, one running windows and another running the app the company needs to do its job, let's say several warehouse management system apps if it's a chain of distribution warehouses.  The NuvlaBox can run all these things at the same in time, which saves money in many ways, as well as reducing complexity of IT management. How does that work then?  The NuvlaBox comes pre-configured with an operating system and [Stratuslab](http://sixsq.com/products/stratuslab.html) as its cloud layer. The user can install his/her own applications or have them pre-installed by SixSq. It's like buying a ready meal, just more healthy.

Now for other cool applications of the box. My five-year old son, who is obsessed with all things construction and agriculture, would love to see it used by a farmer. Sensors are often used in agriculture to take moisture and temperature readings, 

My nine-year old son wants it to be used for playing [Minecraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft), probably because he thinks it will give him unrestricted video game time as he's helping dad.  Matty, it won't. It can host up 3 Minecraft servers allowing all players to have control over the servers 

I personally would **LOVE** to see the NuvlaBox used in the context of **aid work**. It comes into its own in hostile environments. When responding to an emergency, such as an earthquake, aid workers find themselves in need of a secure IT infrastructure, but there is no WiFi, no existing services. The NuvlaBox could be used in exactly such circumstances. If it were configured with the right applications before departure, it would just need to be switched on, and information could be stored, accessed and shared much more quickly and efficiently than is currently the case in such environments.
