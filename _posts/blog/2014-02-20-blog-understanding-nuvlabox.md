**Understanding the uses of the NuvlaBox**

This week, among other things, I've been climbing the learning curve to the pinnacle of **NuvlaBox** understanding. I only needed stiff boots this time, whereas for SlipStream, it was crampons, ropes and ice axes all the way. Does this  mean that the NuvlaBox is easier to understand? Let's see what you think.

It is an appliance, a box about the size of a modem, so it's something I can literally hold in my hand, which helps with my understanding. And it's a beautiful object. I can plug it in and switch it on and it automatically creates its own Wi-Fi network. Cool! I can see the advantage of that, especially if I'm somewhere the network is non-existent or unreliable, and now with my iPad I can connect to it and create a user account with SlipStream. Now what do I do with it?  

Well, I see that it has an great business use and a super cool application for in the field work. 

Let's look at the more everyday use first.  If I have a business running several applications, I can use it as a local cloud, as it can host up to 8 virtual machines. I can replace 8 of the servers I currently run.  For example, it's common to have one server running linux, one running blah and another running blah blah.  All of this can be done on the NuvlaBox, which would save money. 

If I want to access an external cloud, the NuvlaBox is configured (that means I don't have to do anything. Phew!)

Now for the super cool application. I find really interesting that the NuvlaBox can come into its own in hostile environments (not that I go to many of those myself, unless you count the school yard). When responding to an emergency, such as an earthquake, aid workers find themselves in need of a secure IT infrastructure, but there is no WiFi, no existing services. The NuvlaBox could be used exactly is such circumstances,
