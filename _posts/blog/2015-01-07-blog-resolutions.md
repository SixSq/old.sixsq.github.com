What happened to 2014? Gone in a flash, like the mince pies, and no time to properly work on those resolutions. Don't worry, we're here to help you focus, with a few pointers for 2015.

**1. Finally get your head around cloud computing** 

You could start with the Wikipedia definition: 

"*Cloud computing is a recently evolved computing terminology or metaphor based on utility and consumption of computing resources. Cloud computing involves deploying groups of remote servers and software networked that allow centralized data storage and online access to computer services or resources. Clouds can be classified as public, private or hybrid.*" 

What??? 

Or maybe you should head straight some of the great content on the web, like [Webopedia](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cloud_computing.html), [How Stuff Works](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cloud-computing/cloud-computing.htm) or [HighTechDad](http://www.hightechdad.com/2013/02/14/the-10-best-and-worst-cloud-computing-explained-videos-on-youtube/). And check out the cool blogs out there.

**2. Help others**

Technology is an amazing thing, but it’s not just there so you can play Minecraft (although that is seriously cool) or allow you to check on your fridge when you are at the pub. Can you use your skills and tech to use to help others? Technology is crucial, for example, in democratising education in developing countries and bringing medical care to poorly-serviced areas.

**3. Take a trip**

Visit [Cloud Expo Europe](http://www.cloudexpoeurope.com/). Taking place in London from 11 to 12 March 2015, it is Europe’s biggest, best-attended cloud conference. Or if you want to go further afield, check out [elearning Africa](http://www.elearning-africa.com/), a networking event for ICT-enhanced education and training in Africa which will take place in Addis Ababa from 20 to 22 May 2015.

**4. Save money**

If you are frustrated at losing control over expenditure on IT in your organisation, or feel you are spending too much on your cloud resources, take a look at automation tools. They will give you back the ownership of cloud consumption, and provide you with an overview of user access rights, quotas and usage, without spending hours/days/weeks waiting for the information. Working with automation tools makes your work faster and sharable…but above all, more fun. There are several tools out there, like IBM’s [UrbanCode Deploy](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/products/urbancode-deploy/) and [Altassian's Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/). And of course the list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning our own [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html).

**5. Set up a communications calendar**

OK, this applies to lots of things, not just cloud, but we can all benefit from improved communications, both internal and external. This can cover what and when you will take action regarding your website, social media, office meetings. And don’t forget to add birthdays so you can have an excuse for cake….or pizza. Do one for home as well to make sure you take time to chat to the kids or dog or grandma occasionally too!

**6. Take advantage of DevOps**

If you want shorter development cycle, improved error detection and faster time to market, consider incorporating DevOps practises in your company. Put common sense back in the workplace. There is a wealth of information on the web about [DevOps](http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/DevOp) and its [advantages](http://newrelic.com/devops/benefits-of-devops) to help you decide if it's right for you and your organisation. 

The SixSq team wishes you a healthy and fun 2015!
