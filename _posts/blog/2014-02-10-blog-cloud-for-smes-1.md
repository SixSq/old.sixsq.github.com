**Why should an SME transition to the cloud?**

Does cloud computing really bring advantages to small companies? Let’s take the example of Mr. Johnson.  He started with a corner shop and now he has 5 grocery stores in different towns.  He has a point-of-sale system, which is a combination of hardware and software offering checkout facilities, accounting, stock control etc.  He has 2 servers in each location to run his applications and store data, the installation of which he had entrust to an IT company. He pays a maintenance contract so he can call the experts in if there is a problem.  Whenever the software needs updating, a technician has to visit each shop and do his stuff. The system is now a bit outdated and Mr. Johnson would like to change.  He needs more computer power at times of peak workload, but doesn’t want to buy more servers which sit idle most of the time. Of course he has heard of cloud computing, but doesn't really know how it works. Would there be any advantage to him in migrating to the cloud? It would be cool to tell his mates at the pub, but would it bring any **business benefits**? Will it not be too expensive? Is it secure? Reliable? 

Let’s look first of all at **cost reduction**, a key issue for for Mr Johnson and all small companies trying to compete with the big guys:

* Less initial capital expenditure. He will still need his cash registers, but no servers
* Potentially no expensive software packages, as many software vendors provide a pay-as-you-go option.
* Software updates can be done remotely, saving costs on engineer visits etc. 
* Electricity costs are reduced. 
* Expenditure on maintenance contracts is reduced

He can add to that the following advantages:

* **Security**. I covered this issue in a [previous blog](/blog/2014/01/27/blog-cloud-security.html). If he makes the right choices, it is just as secure, if not more so, than his current arrangement
* **Increased reliability**. If there is an outage, a rare event anyway, it will be dealt with immediately at the data centre and he won’t have to wait for an engineer to come to his shop. The cloud providers have experts on hand all the time to deal with problems, which is something Mr. Johnson cannot afford to have. 
* Ability to increase and decrease resource consumption, only paying for what he's used  (pay-as-you-go)

So, he’s sold on the idea. No-brainer - cut costs, hand IT problems over to someone else. Great! Now what? Surf back next week for the latest episode in Johnson’s adventures with the cloud.

If you have similar issues and would like to share them with me, please do so. I'd be happy to explore the problem.
