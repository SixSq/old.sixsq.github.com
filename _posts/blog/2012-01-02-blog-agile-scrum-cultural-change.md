Over the last couple of years, I've been involved in a coaching/training project with [ESA/ESOC](http://www.esa.int/esoc), in Darmstadt, Germany.

What now feels like a bizilion years ago, I worked for with ESA for nearly ten years. Doing my best
to make sense of waterfall processes, since that's what ESA mandated and it's also what I was
told during my engineering studies. After having battle with this strange way of working:

* only ask once users to express their needs in the form of requirements and build a firm fixed
  price contract around this
* take all irreversible (thank you Martin Fowler for this since reference) taken upfront (since most if     
  not all architectural decisions are irreversible!) 
* greet all change as a contract chance (costing!)
* ...

And as if this was not challenging enough, have industry compete for the best proposal, where too often
a low price gives a fantastic advantage over the competition. Well... you end-up with an environment
where success is very hard to achieve and the quality result less than optimal (to remain polite).

As part of the machine, I did try to change this sad state of affaire. My team and I, then
working for VEGA, we had a first success having delivered a real-time simulator in a quarter of the time competition had failed to deliver. Great! To do this we created an agile environment, by necessity (having never heard of agile). Here are the aspect of the project we ran that exhibit agile characteristics:

* Variable scope and real feature prioritisation
* Systematic estimate of each feature, by the team
* Automated, yet simple, build and test system to trap regressions
* Monthly incremental deliveries
* Integrate everything right away and all the time
* Red telephone with the customer
* Instantaneous access to all required documentation

The result was far from what the competing team had originally being asked to deliver. It in fact did
a lot less than was originally required. Urgency provided the right constructive pressure to force
prioritization. This was probably one of the most reveling difference with the 'normal' way of doing things. The other was probably the fact that we integrated the entire system on the target hardware monthly. Showing evidence of improvements, without regressions, provided a comfort zone in which people 
could build confidence in our ability to deliver in time.

Six months later, we delivered this system for production use. During the acceptance of the system, only
three observations (as opposed to snags - i.e. bugs). Which put the cherry on the sunday.

The rest is history...

It took time for people, me included, to understand that this was not only an anomaly in the history of ESOC, resulting
in a new generation of projects using agile and Scrum to emulate the success of this project.  I'm honoured to be involved in some of theme.
