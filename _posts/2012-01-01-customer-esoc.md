Since its creation in 1967, the European Space Operations Centre
(ESOC) in Darmstadt (D) has planned missions, operated more than 60
satellites and ensured that spacecraft meet their mission
objectives. The mandate of ESOC is to conduct mission operations for
ESA satellites and to establish, operate and maintain the necessary
ground segment infrastructure.
