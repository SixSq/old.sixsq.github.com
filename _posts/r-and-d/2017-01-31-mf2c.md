**Fog computing** brings cloud computing capabilities closer to the end-device and users. When put together, cloud and fog computing create a new stack of resources, which we refer to as Fog-to-Cloud (F2C), creating the need for a new, open and coordinated management ecosystem. T

**Project Focus**

* design an open, secure, decentralized, multi-stakeholder management framework
* privacy and security
* data storage techniques
* brokerage solutions
* SLA policies
* resource orchestration methods

The framework sets the foundations for a novel distributed system architecture, developing a proof-of-concept system and platform, to be tested and validated in real-world use cases, as envisioned by the industrial partners in the consortium with significant interest in rapid innovation in the cloud computing sector.


**Funding** Mf2c is funded through the European Commission's H2020
  programme under grant agreement 730929. SixSq is funded by SERI

**Duration:** 36 Months (ends 31/12/2017)
