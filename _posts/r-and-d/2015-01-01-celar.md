The goal of the CELAR project is to develop methods and open-source tools for applying and controlling multi-grained, elastic resource provisioning for Cloud applications in an automated manner.

**Project website:** [http://www.celarcloud.eu](http://www.celarcloud.eu)

**Duration:** 36 Months (ends November 2015)

**Partners:** 8 lead by [Athena](http://www.athena-innovation.gr)

**Goal for SixSq:** SlipStream is used as the core deployment engine for the project.  Scaling features in SlipStream have been developed based on CELAR requirements.

**Features** 

Dynamic resource allocation will be performed through intelligent decision-making based on:

* Cloud and application performance metrics collected and cost-evaluated through a scalable monitoring system and exposed to the user.
* Qualitative and quantitative characterization of the applicationâ€˜s performance through modelling of its elastic properties.
