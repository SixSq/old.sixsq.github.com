[CYCLONE][web] develops a solution for *complete dynamic multi-cloud
application management* from existing, production-quality components.
The solution will include automated application management, advanced
networking, end-to-end security, and federated identity management.
The project will validate and demonstrate the solution via real world
applications, including bioinformatics and smart grid.

SixSq brings SlipStream, a multi-cloud application management
platform, as well as its expertise in cloud computing to the
collaboration.  SlipStream will be used as the basis for automated
application deployments and will be extended to include advanced
networking and security features.  These extensions will benefit
existing SlipStream users and make it an even more compelling
solution.
