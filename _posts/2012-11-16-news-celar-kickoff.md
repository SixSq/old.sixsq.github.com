**Consortium leverages SixSq's SlipStream™ multi-cloud automation engine**
 
Geneva, Switzerland – 16 November 2012 – SixSq announces today that it has joined a consortium to develop automated multi-grained, elastic resource provisioning for cloud applications.  The consortium of seven universities and enterprises span five EU countries including Austria, Cyprus, Greece, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
 
Named ‘CELAR’, the project seeks to address the rapidly increasing applications running over cloud infrastructures and the associated storage, compute and networking resources required as a result. CELAR will provide the European software industry with a modular, completely open-source system that will offer automatic elastic programmability at the platform level. It will be bundled in a single software package for one-click installation of any application alongside its automated resource provisioning over a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
 
Nectarios Koziris, Project Coordinator and Associate Professor of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens said, *“The results of CELAR will be a software package that offers organisations the right amount of resources based on application demand, performance and requirements resulting in optimal use of infrastructure resources and significant reductions in administrative costs.”*
 
CELAR is a €3.5 million project funded under the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for research and technological development. FP7 bundles together all research-related EU initiatives and plays a crucial role in achieving the goals of growth, competitiveness and employment.
 
As part of the consortium, SixSq brings its knowledge in fields of cloud computing, distributed systems, system integration and agile software development. Furthermore, SixSq is responsible for the integration of the solution. Integration of the elastic feature in SlipStream™ will also provide a production ready case study.
 
Marc-Elian Bégin, co-founder at SixSq said, *“Automation in the cloud is key in helping organisations in their transition to cloud infrastructures and services. SlipStream™, our flagship product, is already doing a good job for that.  What CELAR will allow SixSq to do add dynamic and auto-scale behaviour to deployments, and this in a cloud neutral manner. This is new and we're very excited about it.  In return, we hope to bring to the consortium our knowledge in building distributed, robust and production quality software in an iterative and agile way.”*

CELAR technology will be used for massive data management and large-scale collaboration for the on-line gaming realm and also in the area of scientific computing, requiring compute- and storage-intensive genome computations.
 
Under the lead of ATHENA Research and Innovation Center, the CELAR consortium combines a team of leading researchers with industrial and end-user organizations that offer expertise in the cloud application domain and production-level service provisioning.
