SixSq just released a new [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) connector to [VMWare's](http://www.vmware.com) [vCloud](http://www.vmware.com/products/datacenter-virtualization/vcloud-suite/overview.html) IaaS solution. This connector allows SlipStream users to deploy, configure and coordinate parameterised deployments of multi-VM applications on VMWare's enterprise solution, as well as automate the creation of new machine images.

This latest connector adds to an already rich set including OpenStack, StratusLab, OpenNebula, Abiquo, Amazon EC2 and CloudSigma. With this new capability, SixSq increases the neutral zone it offers to its customers with respect to abstracting them from specific IaaS solutions.

*"We're very excited by the capability this vCloud connector provides.  It significantly strengthens our position in the enterprise world where VMWare is well positioned, providing our customers with true reversibility and isolation from vendor lock-in"* says Etienne Coulon, Business Executive at SixSq.

*"It's not just about the connector, it's about the knowledge our team accumulates as we understand the different design choices each cloud provider makes.  This is reflected in SlipStream's ability to strike the right balance between common denominator between the clouds we support and exposing interesting and differentiating features from each solution"* says Marc-Elian BÃ©gin, co-founder at SixSq.

This connector has been validated jointly with [T-Systems](http://www.t-systems.com) in the context of the [Helix Nebula](http://helix-nebula.eu) project and [SR Operations](http://www.sroperations.ch).

This new connector is released under a proprietary license and is compatible with the open source core SlipStream server.

More information on [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html) is available.
