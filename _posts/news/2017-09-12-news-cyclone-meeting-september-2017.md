Members of the SixSq team are in Paris this week for a meeting of the [CYCLONE](http://www.cyclone-project.eu) project. 

**What is CYCLONE all about?**

CYCLONE integrates and extends open source software to create a unified cloud application management solution for application service providers, DevOps, and researchers.

The project partners have identified two flagship domains which have been used to guide the development of the project's tools: 

- [Bioinformatics](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/usecases/1-bioinformatics.html): Leveraging the expertise of partner [The French Insitutute of Bioinformatics](http://www.france-bioinformatique.fr), the team is developing ways to secure human biomedical data and create a cloud virtual pipeline for microbial genomes analysis.
- [Energy](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/usecases/2-energy.html): In order to comply with the climate change mitigation goals of the EU, energy supply has to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This brings a challenge to energy management systems which are unable to cope with decentralised energy production. The team is working on a platform to do make that possible. You can read more about the [Virtual Power Plant](https://cyclone.france-bioinformatique.fr/usecases/view/157) on the CYCLONE website.

The aim of this week's meeting is to review progess made in each work area, including what will be presented at the project's final review at the beginning of 2018.  Great work has been done on the [DACI](https://github.com/cyclone-project/cyclone-DACI) authorisation framework developed by partner University of Amsterdam. 

**What is SixSq's contribution?**

It’s hard to deploy federated applications to multiple clouds and also scale them dynamically. The CYCLONE project relies on [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/index.html), SixSq's multi-cloud application management platform, to ease these activities considerably. SixSq also brings its expertise in cloud computing to the collaboration. 

You can read more about the main components of CYCLONE [here](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/software.html#main-components) and you can try out the project's tools here [http://www.cyclone-project.eu/tryit.html](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/tryit.html).

**What's next?**

The CYCLONE project comes to an end on 31 December 2017, so the team has it's work cut out over the next few months to prepare outstanding demos and presentations for the European Commission's review team.

**Who is involved?**

The CYCLONE project involves 9 partners led by Interoute:

- [Interoute](http://www.interoute.com)
- [SixSq](http://sixsq.com)
- [QSC AG](https://www.qsc.de/de/)
