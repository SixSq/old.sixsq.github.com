SixSq is this week attending the [EU Cloudscape VI Workshop](http://www.cloudscapeseries.eu/Content/WorkshopsAndMeetings.aspx?Cat=0!21) where it will demonstrate the new Helix Nebula Marketplace, **HNX**. [Helix Nebula](http://www.helix-nebula.eu/), fostered by the European Commission, is a pioneering partnership between science and business in Europe. It is paving the way for a Cloud Computing platform that offers a unique resource to governments, businesses and citizens.

HNX, which is powered by SixSqâ€™s application deployment automation tool [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html), gives the scientific research community easy access to commercial cloud services. Its customers will be able to use HNX to choose between various suppliers or combinations of suppliers offering independent Cloud services, and to buy, use and manage such Cloud services seamlessly.

The Cloudscape workshop is for public and private sector IT professionals who need to gain cost and energy efficiencies, help researchers accelerate discovery, provide better citizen services and gain a competitive edge for their businesses in the global marketplace.
