Geneva has unique strengths and intends to demonstrate this: multilateral governance, centres of excellence, diversity, openness to the world, quality of universities and infrastructure. Geneva is where innovative business models of the future, especially in the field of digitalisation and sustainability, are conceived and developed.

The agenda includes interactive panels, open discussions, and contributions from world-renowned experts. SixSq CEO Marc-Elian will be part of the panel entitled [Innovation Secret Recipe](https://www.ge.ch/dossier/geneve-campus-international-innovation/programme-inscriptions).

All the forces that Geneva has in innovation and R & D will be gathered together for this event, including start-ups, SMEs, large companies, research centers, universities, international organisations, non-governmental organizations, incubators and young people in training.
