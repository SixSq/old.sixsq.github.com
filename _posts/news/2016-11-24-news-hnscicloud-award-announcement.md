SixSq has been selected for **two** of the four prestigious design phase contracts granted under the **Helix Nebula - the Science Cloud (HNSciCloud)** project. The contracts are part of the first phase of a €5.3 million pre-commercial procurement tender sponsored by ten of Europe’s leading public research organisations1 and co-funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme. The HNSciCloud project will develop commercial cloud services to help researchers manage and process the enormous amounts of data which will be generated by the scientific community in the coming years. The hybrid cloud platform will enable a competitive marketplace of European cloud players developing their own services for a wider range of users. 

Along with the [RHEA Group](http://www.rheagroup.com), [T-Systems](https://www.t-systems.com) and [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.ch) in one consortium and [Indra](http://www.indracompany.com/en), [HPE](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html) and [Advania](https://advania.com) in another, SixSq will be working on the challenging needs of the European scientific community in both commercial and hybrid clouds. 

*“We are delighted to be involved in this project which brings together European cloud experts and top European research organisations,”* said Marc-Elian Bégin, SixSq’s CEO. *“Despite stiff competition from 12 countries, our technology and capabilities were selected and we are confident that we can make a great contribution to this platform, which will be used for important fields such as high-energy physics, astronomy and life sciences.”*

The [HNSciCloud buyers group](http://www.hnscicloud.eu/partner-type/buyers) consists of highly-demanding scientific laboratories and organisations, such as CERN, the world’s largest particle physics lab, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and CNRS, the French National Centre for Scientific Research. 

The design phase will take full advantage of Nuvla, SixSq’s multi-cloud management platform to access a range of cloud services. The service is based on SlipStream, SixSq’s open source technology which increases quality and speed of application deployment in any cloud. 

Charles Loomis, CTO at SixSq added, *“Our Nuvla service is ideal for addressing the elastic and demanding needs of the scientific community in an open and flexible way, while avoiding lock-in.“* 
The results of the design phase will be part of another competitive tender for the second phase, Solution Prototyping, and only the three most convincing design studies will be chosen for this second phase.
