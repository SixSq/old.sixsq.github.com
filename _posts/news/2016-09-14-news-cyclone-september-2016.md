**Facilitating application deployment to the cloud**
 
As part of its involvement in the [H2020 CYCLONE project](http://www.cyclone-project.eu), the SixSq team has been working hard to develop sophisticated placement and ranking features within [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/).



**What is the Placement and Ranking Service?**

The Placement and Ranking Service within SlipStream allows [policy-based](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/policy-based-management) selection of cloud infrastructures when deploying applications. This service compares application requirements against detailed cloud capability information in the **Service Catalog** to select viable cloud infrastructures for the application. The service will then rank the results according to estimated price.

If you would like to read more about the Service Catalog and automated cloud application placement, take a look at our [blog](http://media.sixsq.com/blog/towards-automated-cloud-application-placement).

**Why is this useful?**

This feature is attractive to both end users and application developers. End users can select a cloud based on a number of criteria including pricing, geographical location, availablility, and capacity. 

It also allows developers to specify a placement policy for application components, for example, limiting where a component can run to meet certain data protection requirements.

By automating the selection process, users can save time when deploying applications while still meeting their placement criteria.  More interestingly, this enables _fully automated scaling_ of applications to optimize the resource usage when demand for the application rises and falls.

SixSq is now exploiting this service to describe the different Service Level Agreements of the services shown in the service catalog so users can find the right cloud for their requirements quickly and systematically. Such a tool is paramount in regulated industries such finance and pharmaceuticals, and builds a robust audit trail from decision to delivery.  In the case of CYCLONE, the feature is put to good test by the existing [energy](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/usecases/2-energy.html) and [bioinformatics](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/usecases/1-bioinformatics.html) use cases. New use cases planned for the last half of the project will test this feature more throughly. 

**What is H2020 Cyclone all about?**

CYCLONE integrates and extends open source software to create a unified cloud application management solution for application service providers, DevOps, and researchers. As itâ€™s notoriously hard to deploy federated applications to multiple clouds and also scale them dynamically, CYCLONE relies on the Slipstream Application Deployment Platform to ease these activities considerably.
