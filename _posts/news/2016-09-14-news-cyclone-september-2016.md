**Facilitating application deployment to the cloud**
 
As part of its involvement in the [H2020 Cyclone project](http://www.cyclone-project.eu), the SixSq team has been working hard to develop the placement and ranking service feature within [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/).



**What is a Placement and Ranking Service?**

A placement and ranking service allows [policy-based](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/policy-based-management) selection of cloud infrastructures when deploying applications. The feature is part of the **Service Catalog** which provides detailed capability information for each available cloud accessible via SlipStream. Using information about each provider, services can be ranked according to criteria defined by the user.

If you would like to read more about the Service Catalogue and automated cloud application placement, take a look at our [blog](http://media.sixsq.com/blog/towards-automated-cloud-application-placement).

**Why is this useful?**

This feature is attractive to both end users and application developers. End users can select a cloud based on a number of criteria including pricing, geographical location and capacity. 

It also allows developers to specify a placement policy for application components, for example, limiting the places where a component can run. 

A placement and ranking service saves an enormous amount of time and resources in the development process and provides greater transparency and stronger governance for the end user. 

SixSq is now exploiting this service to describe the different Service Level Agreements of the services shown in the service catalog so users can find the right cloud for their requirements quickly and systematically. Such a tool is paramount in regulated industries such finance and pharmaceuticals, and builds a robust audit trail from decision to delivery.  In the case of CYCLONE, the feature is put to good test by the [energy](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/usecases/2-energy.html) and [bioinformatics](http://www.cyclone-project.eu/usecases/1-bioinformatics.html) use cases.

**What is H2020 Cyclone all about?**

CYCLONE integrates and extends open source software to create a unified cloud application management solution for application service providers, DevOps, and researchers. As itâ€™s notoriously hard to deploy federated applications to multiple clouds and also scale them dynamically, CYCLONE relies on the Slipstream Application Deployment Platform to ease these activities considerably.
