SixSq is part of the Investigating effective and efficient approaches to trust, assurance and compliance in the ICT market

An EU-financed project studying ways to improve approaches to trust, assurance and compliance in the ICT market has started this month in Berlin. The EU-SEC innovation project is financed by the EU HORIZON 2020 Research and Innovation programme, involves nine partners from seven countries (Germany, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) and will be carried out over a period of three years.

The multinational and multidisciplinary consortium will work to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing approaches for assurance and compliance in the ICT market. To achieve its goal the project EU-SEC will create a framework under which existing, certification and assurance approaches in the ICT market can co-exist. The three core ideas behind the EU-SEC project are that an effective and efficient approach to trust, assurance and compliance has to: 
•	balance the need of nations and business sectors to develop their specific certification schemas with the need of CSPs to reduce compliance costs 
•	avoid that humans (auditors) do activities that can be performed by machines (e.g. collecting data) 
•	make sure that accurate and reliable evidences/information are provided to relevant people, in a timely fashion, leveraging as much as possible automatic means. 

“In recent years the ICT market has evolved toward a cloud-based approach. This shift together with the rapidly changing legal and regulatory landscape has heavily impacted security assurance, governance and compliance,” according to EU-Sec Project coordinator, Linda Strick, senior scientist at Fraunhofer FOKUS. “The project EU-SEC will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing approaches for assurance and compliance.”

The EU-SEC framework will equip stakeholders in the ICT security ecosystem with a validated governance structure, a reference architecture, and the corresponding set of tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current approach to security governance, risks management, assurance and compliance. The EU-SEC aims to enhancing trustworthiness and transparency in the ICT supply chain through business cases developed and piloted by industrial partners.  

A website for the EU-Sec project offering regular news and information about the initiative will be launched in the coming months. The EU-Sec project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.
