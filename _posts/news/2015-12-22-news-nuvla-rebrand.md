SixSq is very pleased to announce that its SlipStream online SaaS is now [Nuvla™](http://sixsq.com/services/nuvla/) 

**Why the name change?**

We wanted to make a clear distinction between the online SlipStream service delivered as SaaS, from the [SlipStream®](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/) technology and product. SlipStream is the SixSq technology powering most of our products and services. Nuvla means cloud in Romansch, one of the four national languages of Switzerland. It also fits well with our turnkey cloud-in-box solution: [NuvlaBox®](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/).

**What's new?**

- The name
- A slightly updated look and feel
- The url: nuv.la (cool hey?)

**What stays the same?**

- Our commitment to provide you with an excellent customer service
- Your login credentials
- Our continued hard work to add new cool features
