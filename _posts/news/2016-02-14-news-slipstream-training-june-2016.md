SixSq's next training event will take place on 7 and 8 June 2016. The training is built around [SlipStreamÂ®](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/), its multi-cloud application manager and will take place at the SixSq offices in Geneva. Places are strictly limited to ensure an enjoyable experience for all participants, so interested parties are encouraged to sign up as soon as possible.

The event will give participants an overview of cloud technologies and their benefits plus practical advice on how to deploy simple and complex applications in the cloud using SlipStream. 

Previous participants have said how much they appreciated the balance between presentation and hands on exercises, and have been able to port applications within a very short time. So take a look at the programme and sign up for 2 days of tech in beautiful Geneva.
