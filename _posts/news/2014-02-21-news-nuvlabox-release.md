**New appliance provides affordable cloud solution for business .**

The NuvlaBox brings the power of the cloud as a plug and play device

Geneva, Switzerland 19 February 2014

SixSq, a cloud solution provider based in Geneva, Switzerland, today announced the launch of the **NuvlaBox**, a turn-key cloud solution for small to medium-sized enterprises. The box, about the size of a modem, comes pre- configured making it simple to use. The NuvlaBox is built entirely out of open source software and has the ability to run several applications simultaneously, supporting all standard operating systems. Applications can be installed from a local or remote app store, in a click. Its internal Wi-Fi network can connect to any device and access cloud services. “We wanted to design a beautiful device we could use in our own office and at the same time provide a simple solution for SMEs struggling with their local IT infrastructure and applications,” said Marc-Elian Bégin, one of the SixSq co- founders. “Smaller companies no longer have to miss out on the financial benefits of cloud computing.”

Used as a stand-alone device, the NuvlaBox brings cost savings by replacing up to 8 servers, but the real beauty is in its ability to connect to an enterprise open app store to provision applications with very little work required by the user, thus enabling a new sales channel for ISVs and software solution providers.

“We are extremely **proud of our team**, the people who have put quality into every stage of the design, integration and manufacturing process,” said Marc- Elian. “NuvlaBox is not just a box, it contains great software, bringing together all of the cloud know-how SixSq has built over the last few years.”

The NuvlaBox has many uses in industry, including sensor aggregation and warehousing. Its ability to rapidly deploy a mobile IT infrastructure makes it valuable to aid workers, and those working in hostile environments, for example rescue and battle situations.

The NuvlaBox is being showcased this week at the Mobile World Congress, which is taking place in Barcelona from 24-27 February 2014. SixSq is one of only 19 exhibitors at the **Swiss Pavilion**. The NuvlaBox can be purchased via the SixSq website and a discount of 10% is applicable to all orders made by 31 March 2014.
