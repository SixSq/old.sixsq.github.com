[Smart City Day](http://www.smartcityday.ch) brings together more than 200 decision-makers from municipalities and cantons to present, discuss and explore the latest developments in the field of smart cities. The success encountered since 2014 makes it the reference  Smart City event in French-speaking Switzerland.

This year the focus will be on the Human Smart City and the event will include presentations from the Vice President of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the Program Manager from The Hague smart city program. The afternoon offers the chance to particpate in various workshops, such as **"Sharing experience with Smart Cities"** and **"How to design the energies of cities of the future"**.

Three stands you should take time to visit are:

- SixSq, of course, where you will be able to see the [NuvlaBox](http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox/) edge and cloud computing device in action.
- [CityZen](http://www.cityzen.ch), where you can find out about the CityZen park and the [Volumlight](http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox/usecases/#30%-Energy-Savings-Thanks-To-Smart-Lighting-Solution) smart street lighting solution, a great example of how the CityZen partnership works.
- [Schr√©der Swiss](http://www.schreder.com/fr-ch) which will have the [Shuffle](http://www.schreder.com/fr-CH/produits/shuffle/) lighting system on display.
