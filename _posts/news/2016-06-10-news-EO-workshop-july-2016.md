The Swiss Space Office ([SSO](http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/themen/01371/index.html?lang=en)) is organising an Information Day for the Swiss Industrial and Scientific Community related to the future Earth Observation ([EO](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth)) programmes of the European Space Agency ([ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA)).  

**What is Earth Observation?**

Earth observation is the gathering of information about planet Earth’s physical, chemical and biological systems. It involves monitoring and assessing the status of the natural and man-made environment. With advancements in technology, most importantly satellite innovation, Earth Observation has become more and more sophisticated. 

**Why do we need it?**

The benefits of Earth Observation to society, science and the economy are well documented. The data provided helps us forecast weather, monitor environmental and climatic change, track atmospheric pollution, respond to natural disasters and much more. 

Examples of ESA programmes are:

- **Earth Observation Envelope Programme** which is the backbone of ESA activities in the field of Earth observation. It presents a stable planning environment within which new types of environmental sensing technologies and the missions that will fly them are prepared.
- **European Earth Watch Programme** which is aimed at extending and improving global records to support climate science and policy.

**Why is SixSq involved?**

Following on from its participation in the [Helix Nebula Initiative](http://www.helix-nebula.eu), SixSq is involved in forming an Earth Observation data processing platform which will be built around European public cloud providers. SixSq's [Nuvla](http://sixsq.com/services/nuvla/) service, its [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/) as a Service offer, will be the foundation to democratise access to earth observation open data and boost innovation in Europe. SixSq is leading the way in establishing Switzerland and Europe as thought leaders in this field.
 
Results from the workshop in July will help Member States of ESA to decide about the future of ESA’s Earth Observation programmes at the next Council at Ministerial level, which will be held in Lucerne at the end of 2016.

**When?**
13 July 2016

**Where?**
State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation [SERI, Bern](http://www.sbfi.admin.ch/org/index.html?lang=en), Switzerland
