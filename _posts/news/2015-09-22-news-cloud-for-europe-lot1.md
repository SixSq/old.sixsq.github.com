[SixSq](http://sixsq.com), a smart cloud automation solutions provider headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, has been selected as one of the suppliers to the prestigious [Cloud for Europe project](http://www.cloudforeurope.eu).  The company will start work on 1 October 2015 as part of a consortium with the highly respected [Cloud Security Alliance](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org). 

Cloud For Europe supports public sector cloud use via collaboration between public authorities and industry. The project identifies challenges and looks for innovative solutions to build trust in European cloud computing, thereby finding ways to overcome obstacles for the adoption of cloud computing by the public sector.  The project is a key part of the European Commission’s European [Cloud Computing Strategy](http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-cloud-initiative).

SixSq CEO, Marc-Elian Bégin said, “This contract is a great opportunity to bring cloud computing innovation to governments and public organisations with no compromise on security and citizen data privacy.  We will demonstrate with CSA how clear governance and smart technology can make a real positive impact on society.” 

SixSq has demonstrated its expertise on European cloud computing via its work with leading institutions such as the European Space Agency, CERN and the European Commission.  The company plays a key role in the [Helix Nebula Marketplace](http://www.helix-nebula.eu/), which is providing commercial cloud services to scientific organisations. SixSq also delivers innovative solutions to commercial customers such as Atos, T-Systems and Interoute. Due to its highly-skilled, multi-national team, the company has enjoyed success both in Switzerland and abroad.

SixSq CTO, Charles Loomis, added, “We are looking forward to working with the Cloud Security Alliance, which is the world’s leading organisation dedicated to ensuring a secure cloud environment. We will leverage CSA’s STAR registry to allow users of SlipStream, SixSq’s cloud application manager, to select commercial cloud services based on their security requirements automatically, further streamlining the provisioning phase of cloud application deployment.”
