Following the success of the last event, which was a sell out, SixSq is running another training event built around [SlipStreamÂ®](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/), its multi-cloud application manager. The training will take place at the SixSq offices in Geneva and places are strictly limited to ensure an enjoyable experience for all participants.

The event will give participants an overview of cloud technologies and their benefits plus practical advice on how to deploy simple and complex applications in the cloud using SlipStream.

Previous participants have said how much they appreciated the balance between presentation and hands on exercises, so take a look at the programme and sign up for 2 days in beautiful Geneva.
