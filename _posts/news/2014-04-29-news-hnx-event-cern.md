**Helix Nebula - The Science Cloud: From Cloud Active to Cloud Productive, powered by SlipStream from SixSq**

Geneva, Switzerland 29 April 2014

On 14 May 2014 SixSq will be presenting at a [CERN public event](http://indico.cern.ch/event/293382/?utm_content=buffer3d55b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) where it will demonstrate the use of SlipStream as a broker in the new Helix Nebula Marketplace, **HNX**. [Helix Nebula](http://www.helix-nebula.eu/), fostered by the European Commission, is a pioneering partnership between science and business in Europe. It is paving the way for a Cloud Computing platform that offers a unique resource to governments, businesses and citizens and which is charting a course towards sustainable provision of cloud computing for Europe.

HNX's broker is powered by SixSqâ€™s application deployment automation tool [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html), gives the scientific research community easy access to commercial cloud services. Its customers will be able to use HNX to choose between various suppliers or combinations of suppliers offering independent Cloud services, and to buy, use and manage such Cloud services seamlessly.

The workshop on 14 May 2014 is for open to the public, although [registration](http://indico.cern.ch/event/293382/registration/register#/register) is required by 1 May 2014.
