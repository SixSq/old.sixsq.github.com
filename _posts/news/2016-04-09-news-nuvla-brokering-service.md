**New smart cloud brokerage service providing cost effective access to wide range of cloud providers**

SixSq, a smart cloud automation solutions provider headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, today announced the upgrade of its [Nuvla](http://sixsq.com/services/nuvla/) service into a fully managed brokerage service. 

Nuvla is SixSq's self-managed multi-cloud application deployment service, powered by [SlipStream®](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/). 

This new service will provide customers with all the automation provided by the current service over a wide range of commercial IaaS offers, but now adds the following benefits:

- one contract, 
- one bill
- one dashboard and 
- one trusted advisor

The new brokerage service will be fully available from September 2016. The service is now open for limited beta.
SixSq has already secured a number of reseller deals, and will be expecting to offer brokerage via the
following cloud services:

- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [ExoScale](https://www.exoscale.ch/)
- [Interoute VDC2.0](https://cloudstore.interoute.com/TryInterouteVDCFREE)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- [Open Telekom Cloud (T-Systems)](https://www.t-systems.com/de/en/solutions/cloud/solutions/open-telekom-cloud/public-cloud-for-business-customers-247826)
- [Orange Business Services](http://www.orange-business.com/en/cloud-computing)
- [IBM SoftLayer](http://www.softlayer.com)
- [Ultimum Technologies](http://ultimum.io/)

The brokerage service also supports the connection to private clouds, based on:

- [CloudStack]((https://cloudstack.apache.org) )
- [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/)
- [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/)
- [VMware vCloud](https://www.vmware.com/cloud-computing/overview)

*“Our new brokerage service is a natural evolution of our Nuvla service. We are now ready to offer this
service to a wide range of users. With our partners, we are already working on offering this service to the
public sector and I expect the private sector to follow.”* said Marc-Elian Bégin, SixSq CEO.

The billing module of SlipStream, released as part of the enterprise version of the software is what makes the difference. Partly developed with the Geneva Engineering School (Hepia), *"The solution allows users to predict
and compare application costs before choosing the cloud service to deploy to. The user can then monitor its
spending across all clouds from a single dashboard, before receiving consolidated billing statements at the end
of every month,"* said Charles Loomis, SixSq CTO.

SixSq is also launching its reseller program, which will allow partners to integrate Nuvla into their
solutions and take advantage of the truly neutral and multi-cloud service.
