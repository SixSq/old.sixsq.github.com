This week **Helix Nebula â€“ the science cloud** started its Pilot Phase with SlipStream, created by SixSq. SlipStream will allow Helix Nebula users (CERN, ESA and EMBL) to provision complex cloud applications, on several IaaS clouds in parallel, automatically.

During the Pilot Phase, CERN, ESA and EMBL will test their ability to manage several
cloud services, such that they can better distribute and consume cloud resources, in
a federated manner. SlipStream is initially configured to connect to Atos's Helix
Nebula Scientific Cloud Service, CloudSigma's Public Cloud and Interoute's Virtual
Data Center (VDC) Service.

The Pilot Phase will run for several months, providing valuable experience to the
users, so that they can better integrate the new Helix Nebula federated cloud resource
in their own provisioning processes.

More information on [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html) is available.
