Members of the SixSq team will be in Amsterdam this week to participate in the [H2020 Cyclone](http://www.cyclone-project.eu) collaboration meeting. The CYCLONE project, part of the EU's [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020) programme, is developing a solution for complete dynamic multi-cloud application management from existing, production-quality components. The solution will include automated application management, advanced networking, end-to-end security, and federated identity management. The project will validate and demonstrate the solution via real world applications, including bioinformatics and smart grid.

Participants at this week's meeting will discuss, among other things, security infrastructure and use case requirements for authentication, authorisation and resource management. 

The meeting will include a one-day workshop on [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/), SixSq's application deployment platform, which is being used as the basis for automated application deployments and is being extended to include advanced networking and security features.
