**[Euresearch](https://www.euresearch.ch/en/)** is the Swiss network mandated by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) providing targeted information, hands-on advice and trans-national partnering related to European research and innovation programmes. 

The organisation regularly publishes [success stories](https://www.euresearch.ch/en/about-euresearch/media-corner/success-stories/) to promote participation in the [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) Research and Innovation programme and showcase examples of companies who have made a success out of project participation. SixSq was recently featured in one of these success stories, thanks to its contribution to the [SCISSOR](https://scissor-project.com) project. 

SCISSOR (Security in Trusted SCADA and Smart Grids) aims to keep critical infrastructures such as power stations and dams safe from hacking and environmental disruption. To find out more about how  SCISSOR is improving of critical infrastuctures, read about the smart grid deployment in [Favignana](http://sixsq.com/resources/2017/05/15/news-scissor-meeting-may-2017.html).

SixSq CTO, [Dr Charles Loomis](http://sixsq.com/about-us/), was interviewed for the Euresearch article. “SCISSOR’s goal is to enhance protection while improving reliability and efficiency," said Dr Loomis. “Once, we were open to joining any EU project," he added. “Now, a project must be aligned with our roadmap so that it can make a concrete contribution to our company. We basically fund our R&D by participat­ ing in European projects."
