**Sign up for key insights into smart technologies & digital disruptions**

What does cloud mean for the European digital single market? How is technology changing the way we do things? This and much more will be discussed at the [Cloudscape Series Conference 2016](http://www.cloudscapeseries.eu/)  Among the topics will be the Internet of Things, Smart Citizenship and the procurement of cloud services. 


SixSq's CEO, Marc-Elian Bégin, will be participating in the panel entitled "Towards better public procurement of cloud services in Europe", which will look at the challenges in procuring cloud services."The European cloud scene is rich, varied and innovative," said Marc-Elian. "Public administrations are right to seriously consider the benefits these services can bring them. However, all have to adapt in order to bridge current procurement practices and delivery models.  Innovation is required on all fronts."
