[Smart City Day](http://www.smartcityday.ch) is a key event in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. It brings together over 200 decision makers from cities, cantons and the business world in order to present projects and developments in smart cities. For its 3rd edition, the event will highlight the **governance** models fostering the achievement of smart cities. 

During the course of the event, participants will have the chance to visit the various stands and listen to key speakers talking about the latest movements in the Smart City field. 

SixSq has been invited to participate by [Alp ICT](http://www.alpict.com/en/). **Alp ICT** is an initiative of the Cantons of Bern, Fribourg, Vaud, Valais, Neuchâtel, Geneva and Jura and  acts as a partner linking business, R&D, financial and political players. It particularly targets businesses with a potential to develop into international players.
