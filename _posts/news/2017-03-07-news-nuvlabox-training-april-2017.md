SixSq's next training event will take place on 4 & 5 April 2017. The training is built around NuvlaBoxÂ®, the company's smart cloud-in-a-box solution and will take place at the SixSq offices in Geneva. 

Smart sensors and devices used as part of the **Internet of Things** will generate data on an enormous scale. In order to provide businesses and municipalities with useful insights into this data, it has to be analysed and processed, most of which is currently done in the cloud or data centres. This can be costly, time consuming and risky.   **Edge computing** solutions bring data storage and processing to the extremes of the network. They enable analytics and knowledge generation to occur at the source of the data, increasing productivity and efficiency. 

This training looks at edge computing solutions and explains the specific benefits and challenges around using edge computing for enterprise IoT data storage and processing. It centres around the NuvlaBox, SixSq's smart cloud-in-a-box appliance, and is full of practical advice and hands-on exercises.

Places are strictly limited to ensure an enjoyable experience for all participants, so interested parties are encouraged to sign up as soon as possible.

Take a look at the program and sign up for 2 days of training in beautiful Geneva.
