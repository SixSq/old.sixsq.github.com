[Darest](http://www.darest.ch) and SixSq
announced today the release of
the DS-Cloud Ready Pack.  This commercial cloud solution is a turnkey
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud solution, which makes use of
the StratusLab project's open-source cloud computing distribution.

"For Darest, the creation of the DS-ReadyPack is an opportunity
to join forces with SixSq to create a new offer in the growing
field of cloud computing" says Samuel Mellot, CTO of Darest.  The Swiss
IT Solutions provider will distribute the product integrated by SixSq.

The nervous system of this software solution is provided by 
SixSq's [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) and
OpenNebula.
OpenNebula provides the cloud
functionality, while Slipstream allows for automated deployment,
ensuring simple, reproducible and safe provisioning of virtual
environments.

This new product targets small and medium enterprises looking for a
private cloud solution.  A series of managed services are also being
delivered, including a public StratusLab Marketplace and SlipStream
services, providing users with up-to-date images, as well as
construction and deployment recipes.

"Being able to create a commercial product, based on SlipStream
software, with companies like Darest is very exciting." says
Marc-Elian BÃ©gin, Co-founder of SixSq.  "This shows how well focused FP7
projects can really make a difference in the commercial world and give
SMEs like SixSq a significant edge."
