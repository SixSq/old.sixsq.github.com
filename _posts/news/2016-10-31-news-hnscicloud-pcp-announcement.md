The winners of the Helix Nebula Science Cloud tender will be announced in Lyon this week at the [CC-IN2P3 (CNRS)](http://cc.in2p3.fr/?lang=en) premises, one of the main academic data centres in France.

Helix Nebula – the Science Cloud has launched on behalf of a buyers group a €5.3 million Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) tender for the establishment of a European hybrid cloud platform to support the deployment of high-performance computing and big-data capabilities for scientific research.

The [buyers group](http://www.hnscicloud.eu/partner-type/buyers) includes prestigious European research organisations, such as CERN, CNRS, EMBL and KIT, all challenged with a deluge of data to process as part of their research programs.

A total of 28 multinational companies, SMEs and public research organisations from 12 countries submitted bids during the summer. The 4 winning consortia will be announced at the event and will present their visions for the hybrid cloud platform. Members of the SixSq team will be attending and keeping fingers crossed that they will be amongst the successful teams. 

More information about the event is available on the [Helix Nebula website](http://www.hnscicloud.eu).
