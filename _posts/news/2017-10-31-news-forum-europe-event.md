SixSq CEO [Marc-Elian Bégin](http://media.sixsq.com/blog/author/marc-elian-b%C3%A9gin) will be speaking at the 3rd edition of the Public Sector Transformation Conference, which this year will focus on the digitisation of cities and subsequent strengthening of government-citizen relationships. Drawing on case studies from Europe and around the world, the event will examine
high-capacity infrastructure & **edge computing capabilities that power smart cities** and how new data sources can be exploited to develop new citizen applications.

The event is being organised by [Forum Europe](http://www.forum-europe.com/), a leading EU confernce provider with more than 25 years experience of planning and executing events, and [Hewlett Packard Enterpise](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html).

Marc-Elian will be speaking during the session entitled "Open Ecosystems and Data Governance: Conditions for smart applications." The panel will address the crucial aspect of how cities can create and cater to the demand for transformed public services. Speakers will address how cities can be responsive to citizen’s actual requirements so that services can be targeted at them.
