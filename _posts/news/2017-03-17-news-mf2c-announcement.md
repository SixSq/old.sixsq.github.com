SixSq is pleased to announce its involvement in **H2020 mF2C**, an EU-financed project looking at  many of the detailed technical problems which arise at the intersection of fog computing and cloud computing. The project kicked off on 1 January 2017. The mobile Fog to Cloud project addresses the need for an open and coordinated managing of fog and cloud computing systems.

**What is Fog computing?**

Fog computing, also known as fog networking or fogging, is a decentralised computing infrastructure in which data, compute, storage and applications are distributed in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. Fog computing extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network, bringing the advantages and power of the cloud closer to where data is created and acted upon.

**Why is it important?**

With the number of devices exponentially growing globally, new cloud and fog models are expected to emerge, paving the way for collaborative, mobile, volatile and dynamic compute, storage and network infrastructures. When put together, cloud and fog computing create a new stack of resources, which we refer to as Fog-to-Cloud (F2C), creating the need for a new, open and coordinated management ecosystem.

**How is the project funded?**

SixSq's participation is supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation **[SERI][seri]** under contract number 16.0202. The remaining partners are  financed by the [EU HORIZON 2020 Research and Innovation programme](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020).
