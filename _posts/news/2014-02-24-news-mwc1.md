Three members of the SixSq team, Marc-Elian BÃ©gin, Robert Branchat and Samuel Mellot, started their day early today to breakfast at the Swiss Embassy in Barcelona.  Then it's back to the [Mobile World Congress](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/) to  continue with demos of the [NuvlaBox](http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox.html). There will be no time for them to visit the sights of Barcelona if only a fraction of the expected 72,000 visitors stop by the [Swiss Pavilion](http://static.morethanchocolate.ch/). 

The event is going well so far and the team are looking forward to showcasing their new gizmo to potential customers.
