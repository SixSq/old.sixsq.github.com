Three members of the SixSq team, Marc-Elian BÃ©gin, Robert Branchat and Samuel Mellot, started their day early today to be ready for the first demos of the [NuvlaBox](http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox.html). There will be no time for them to visit the sights of Barcelona if only a fraction of the expected 72,000 visitors stop by the [Swiss Pavilion](http://static.morethanchocolate.ch/).
