SixSq, a cloud solution provider headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and member of the [RHEA](http://www.rheagroup.com/) Group, will participate at the upcoming [Cloud Expo Europe 2015](http://www.cloudexpoeurope.com/Content/Welcome/1/), the largest and best attended Cloud conference and exhibition in Europe. The company will be showcasing its full portfolio of cloud solutions at stand 300 at London’s ExCel arena from 11th – 12th March 2015. 

Since its foundation in 2007, SixSq flagship product, [SlipStream®](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream.html), has been successfully used by commercial and institutional customers to interface easily with multiple cloud computing services. The software gives IT managers total control of their computing resources through a self-service portal that enables full visibility and management of their cloud usage. The solution can be installed on-premise or used as-a -Service.

Cloud Expo Europe is regarded as the best place to discover the industry’s newest and upcoming technologies and business solutions. There will be 300 exhibitors and 300 expert speakers all under the close inspection of an expected 15,000 attendees. 

SixSq CEO, Marc-Elian Bégin said, “Cloud Expo Europe is the ideal venue to meet people who are passionate about cloud computing and cutting edge technologies. Talking to our customers, we see they have concerns about ease of use and vendor lock-in, and we want to demonstrate how our solutions can address those issues.” Marc-Elian will be participating in the panel discussion entitled “Are Hybrid Clouds Real or Imaginary” on 12th march at 14:40 in the Service Provider and Cloud Ecosystems Conference Theatre. 

SixSq role in the [Helix Nebula initiative](http://helix-nebula.eu/), a partnership between big science and business players under the leadership of CERN, ESA and EMBL to chart the cloud computing development in Europe, has established SixSq as a European cloud expert. SixSq has recently taken over the hosting, management and support of [Helix Nebula Marketplace](http://hnx.helix-nebula.eu/).  

SixSq Business Development Manager, Juliane Frömmter, added, “We are looking forward to meeting other exhibitors, particularly service providers, to talk about the challenges they are facing. We want to talk to public, private, local, national or international organisations in need of streamlining their application deployment processes in the cloud.”
