Members of the SixSq team are in Thessaloniki this week for the latest plenary meeting of the [PaaSword](https://www.paasword.eu) project. 

**What is PaaSword all about?**

Although enterprises recognize the compelling economic and operational benefits of running applications and services in the Cloud, security and data privacy concerns are the main barriers to Cloud adoption. Valuable business benefits cannot be unlocked without addressing new data security challenges posed by Cloud Computing. PaaSword aims at fortifying the trust of individuals and corporate customers in Cloud-enabled services and applications. The focus is on secure storage of both corporate and personal sensitive data on Cloud infrastructures.

**What is SixSq's contribution?**

SixSq's cloud management platform, [SlipStream](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream), is being used as the PaaS solution for orchestration of distributed applications on Clouds, with the help of [Nuvla](http://sixsq.com/services/nuvla/), the company's managed SlipStream service.

The project continues until 31 December 2017.
