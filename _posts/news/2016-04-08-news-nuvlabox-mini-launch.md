**Smart Cloud-in-a-Box Appliance offers simple, secure IT solution**

SixSq, a cloud solutions provider headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, today announced the launch of two new versions of its smart cloud-in-a-box appliance, the [NuvlaBox](http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox/). 

The NuvlaBox is a **cloud-in-a-box appliance** which provides a simple, secure and private IT solution. Its capacity to be managed and updated remotely makes it ideal for deployment in remote areas, yet it also brings financial benefits to enterprise and SMEs in standard business environments, as well as Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart City applications.

The upgraded version of the standard NuvlaBox provides improved environmental resistance to dust and temperature, as well as increased security and extended connectivity capabilities, including ethernet, WiFi, mobile and satellite.
The **NuvlaBox Mini** provides a cheaper entry point to cloud computing and is aimed at Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart City applications. By virtue of the remote management feature, thousands of units can be controlled from a single location.

The NuvlaBoxes are manufactured in Europe by [Logic Supply](http://www.logicsupply.com/nl-en/), a leading industrial fan-less PC company which provides rugged, highly-configurable computers specifically engineered for reliability. 

SixSq CEO, Marc-Elian Bégin said, *“Working closely with Logic Supply, we have been able to customise the box and make it into a unique integrated product with **excellent customer support**. We are looking for reseller partners and distributors who would be interested in bringing this innovative and exciting product to its customers and open new markets.”*

The new models of the NuvlaBox and its management eco-system will be showcased at the [Cloud Expo Europe](http://www.cloudexpoeurope.com) event, which is taking place at the **ExCel Centre in London from 12 to 13 April 2016**.
