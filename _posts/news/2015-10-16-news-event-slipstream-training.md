SixSq is running another training event built around SlipStream, its multi-cloud application manager.
The event will give participants an overview of cloud technologies and their benefit and practical advice on how to deploy simple and complex applications in the cloud using SlipStream.

SixSq CEO, Marc-Elian Bégin said, “We realise this is a very complex field and even technical people struggle to differentiate the solutions out there on the market. We run this training to offer practical, hands on advice on cloud and how tools like SlipStream can bring real benefits to business.” 

Previous participants have said how much they appreciated the balance between presentation and hands on exercises, so take a look at the programme and sign up for 2 days in beautiful Geneva.
