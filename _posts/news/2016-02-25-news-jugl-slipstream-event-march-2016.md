**Calling all Java and Clojure fans!**

[SlipStream®](http://sixsq.com/products/slipstream/) by SixSq is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) multi-cloud solution built on open source professional software delivering automated full life-cycle application management on all major clouds. SlipStream can both be installed on premise or used on our own SlipStream backed platform at [Nuvla™](http://sixsq.com/services/nuvla/).

[JUGL](https://community.oracle.com/community/java) is a Java User Group which aims to meet Java platform users based around the Leman Lake and in Suisse Romande generally. Its purpose is to facilitate discussions on usage and evolution of Java and establish links between different communities (developers, architects, students, teachers ...) interested in this technology. 

The group has organised an event based around the SlipStream architecture which will give participants the chance to discuss the technical choices and the interaction between Java and Clojure.

If you are interested in attending the event, sign up via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/billets-slipstream-architecture-java-and-clojure-at-work-21352514947?aff=es2).
