SixSq is very pleased to announce that its [NuvlaBox](http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox/) service has passed the stringent G-Cloud 9 framework audit and has been accepted onto the UK’s Digital Marketplace. The Digital Marketplace is used by UK public sector organisations to find people and technology for digital projects. Buying services through the framework means that organisations can save on the time and cost of entering into individual procurement contracts.

The cloud-based services on the Digital Marketplace are split into 4 categories:

- Cloud Hosting i.e. cloud platforms or infrastructure
- Cloud Software, i.e. software applications that are accessed over the internet and hosted in the cloud.
- Cloud Support, i.e. cloud support services to help you set up and maintain your cloud software or hosting services.

SixSq’s NuvlaBox features in the Cloud Hosting category. It is a turnkey instant private cloud solution which is secure, affordable and simple to use. It includes a plug and play device with remote management & application update capabilities. A non-technical operator can easily and securely set up the appliance. Multi-cloud app store and unified dashboard simplify operations.

For further information, check out the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/327544682430488).
