SixSq is very pleased to announce that its [NuvlaBox](http://sixsq.com/products/nuvlabox/) service has passed the stringent G-Cloud audit and has been accepted onto the UK's [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk). The Digital Marketplace is used by UK public sector organisations to find people and technology for digital projects. Buying services through the framework means that organisations can save on the time and cost of entering into individual procurement contracts.

The **cloud-based services** on the Digital Marketplace are split into 4 categories:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), eg content delivery networks or hosting
- Platform as a Service (PaaS), eg platforms that provide a basis for building other services and applications
- Software as a Service (SaaS), eg accounting tools or customer service management software
- Specialist Cloud Services (SCS), eg IT health checks or data migrations

SixSq's NuvlaBox features in the **PaaS** and **SCS** categories. It is a turnkey instant private cloud solution which is secure, affordable and simple to use. It includes a plug and play device with remote management & application update capabilities. A non-technical operator can easily and securely set up the appliance. Multi-cloud app store and unified dashboard simplify operations.
