Security and data protection issues are a significant barrier to wider
use of cloud platforms.  PaaSword aims to reduce those barriers by
providing trusted, secure storage on cloud services.  It will use
encryption, advanced policy-based placement and context-aware access
control to realize secure, trusted cloud storage. 

SixSq will use SlipStream as a "Platform as a Service" to demonstrate
how the project's storage components can be deployed easily as part of
a larger, web-based application.  On one hand, SlipStream is a use
case for the project, but SixSq will also enhance SlipStream with
features to facilitate the implementation and use of PaaSword storage
components. 

**Project website:** [http://paasword.io][web]

**Funding** PaaSword is funded through the European Commission's H2020
  programme under grant agreement 644814. SixSq is supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation **[SERI][seri]** under contract number 15.0047.

**Duration:** 36 Months (ended 31/12/2017) 

**Partners:** 10 lead by [CAS][cas]

**Goal for SixSq:** Main contribution is bringing a “use case” for
  deployment of applications needing secure storage to the cloud.
  Integration of project software into SlipStream *Platform as a
  Service* feature set.
