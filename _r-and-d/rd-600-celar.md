**The goal of the CELAR project is to develop methods and open-source tools for applying and controlling multi-grained, elastic resource provisioning for Cloud applications in an automated manner.**

**Goal for SixSq:** SlipStream is used as the core deployment engine for the project.  Scaling features in SlipStream have been developed based on CELAR requirements.

**Main features**

Dynamic resource allocation will be performed through intelligent decision-making based on:

 * Cloud and application performance metrics collected and cost-evaluated through a scalable monitoring system and exposed to the user.
 * Qualitative and quantitative characterisation of the applicationâ€˜s performance through modelling of its elastic properties.
