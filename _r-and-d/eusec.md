The EU-SEC project is studying ways to improve approaches to trust, assurance and compliance in the ICT market. To achieve its goal the project EU-SEC will create a framework under which existing, certification and assurance approaches in the ICT market can co-exist.

The EU-SEC framework will equip stakeholders in the ICT security ecosystem with a validated governance structure, a reference architecture, and the corresponding set of tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current approach to security governance, risk management, assurance and compliance. The EU-SEC aims to enhance trustworthiness and transparency in the ICT supply chain through business cases developed and piloted by industrial partners.
