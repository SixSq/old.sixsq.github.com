For most smaller organisations, the cost of a private cloud infrastructure is prohibitive. With the NuvlaBox, you get an affordable entry point into cloud computing. NuvlaBox includes complete Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions. All communication is encrypted and deployments automated for higher security. This means that there is no compromise on cloud capabilities. Or security. And it's all yours.

                    Smart factory settings and zero config means it's a child's play to set up and use. You plug it in, power it up and you are good to go. Combined with its remote-control capabilities, this means you don't always need IT experts on-site.

                    Once powered-up, the box will create its own local Wi-Fi network, which can be used by any device (e.g. laptop, smart phone, tablet, pc). The NuvlaBox can also be remote controlled.
