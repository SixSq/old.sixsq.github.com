                    <p>Repetitive, manual deployments are costing your organisation money. Introducing automation will reduce expenditure and give your people more time to create greater things. Nuvla even takes away the burden to run your own service.</p>

                    <h2>Cloud Neutrality as a Service</h2>
                    <p>Nuvla communicates with all connected IaaS cloud services via a connector architecture. This means we're already talking to many clouds you use and will make it easier for you to deploy your apps there. Or if you can't decide which cloud to use, Nuvla takes the stress out of making the wrong decision. Nuvlaâ€™s cloud neutrality means it isolates users from vendor lock-in, providing unprecedented flexibility in your choice of cloud solutions. All this as a service.</p>

                    <p>If your private cloud is not giving you all you need, but you don't want to invest in more infrastructure, you can use Nuvla to scale out to a public cloud and get the best of both worlds.</p>

                    <p>Take advantage of existing templates, such as load balancers, database clusters, Hadoop systems and more. But don't stop there, you can extend these and create your own. You can also take advantage of configuration management systems, such as Puppet, Chef and Ansible. What about Docker? It's also batteries included, with support for Docker and Docker Swarms. And again, all this from the comfort of a managed service.</p>
