NuvlaRetail makes intensive use of video analytics software, including AI, for facial recognition. No personal data is stored on the people being filmed, making the solution compliant with data privacy legislation. Instead, the software automatically calculates a unique signature for identifying people and only that signature is stored.

Cameras are deployed at strategic points in the store and are connected to an edge device running the [NuvlaBox](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software. The edge devices and the application software are deployed and managed through the [Nuvla](/products-and-services/nuvla/overview) software management platform.

When a registered customer enters the store, relevant data is pulled from the company's CRM. Sales staff can then approach the customer armed with name and purchase history, enabling a much more meaningful interaction with the client.
