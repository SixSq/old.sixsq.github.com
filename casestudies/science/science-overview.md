Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) refers to a constellation of satellites providing signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data to GNSS receivers. The receivers then use this data to determine location. The GNSS Big Data project will create a disruptive solution to provide the GNSS developer community and public authorities with tools to gather new insights from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.

## Here's how it works
{: class="pb-20"}

Large data sets, produced and stored on edge and cloud, need to be made available for post-processing and analysis to facilitate derivation of valuable information.

Nuvla.io enables this process by providing users with data registration, management and processing capabilities via reach web UI and API.

Meta-data about the collected data, residing on edge or cloud and on different storage types, can be registered in Nuvla.io using user defined schemas, updated, tagged, combined into data sets, search for and pre-registered user applications can be started by Nuvla.io automatically where the data is actually located. The latter we call "Open with..." feature.

This rich set of functionalities lets our clients to push their boundaries by bridging the gap between edge and cloud.

This case study is a good example of successful usage of Nuvla.io data management features for the benefits of the Big Data science community built by European Space Agency (ESA) around GNSS.

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) refers to a constellation of satellites providing signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data to GNSS receivers. The receivers then use this data to determine location, earth and ionospheric events, malicious GNSS signal jammers and many more. The GNSS Big Data project is creating a disruptive solution to provide the GNSS developer community and public authorities with tools to gather new insights from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data.
