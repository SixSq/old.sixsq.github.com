In partnership with Schr√©der Swiss, SixSq has developed an **adaptive lighting** solution which brings an unparalleled opportunity to deliver savings. By implementing this solution cities can **reduce energy consumption** by 30%, whilst still respecting safety standards. With this system, lighting levels are continually updated to reflect real-time traffic patterns, providing savings during periods of low circulation and ensuring safety at all times. Operational costs are also reduced thanks to the remote management capabilities of Nuvla.io. The solution has been successfully implemented in numerous European cities.

The solution leverages the power of the [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software and the [Nuvla.io](/nuvla-io/overview) to command and control the edge devices hosting the adaptive lighting software. This can be extended to cover monitoring of air quality, sound pollution and much more without further intrusion into the city's infrastructure.

Here's how it works:
