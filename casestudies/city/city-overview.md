Edge computing opens up new possibilites for the smart city. Using the [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview) management platform, smart city operators have not only a real-time snapshot of what is happening throughout the city, but they can also analyse the data provided by edge sensors to manage resources, [fuse data](https://media.sixsq.com/blog/data-fusion-at-the-edge), inform planning and implement strong [governance](https://media.sixsq.com/blog/smart-city-governance-for-open-data-and-edge-computing). Plus they can update, add and upgrade their fleet of apps running at the edge at any time.


## The adaptive lighting example that delivers 30% energy savings
[ELEKTRON](https://www.elektron.ch/en/), the leading Swiss technology company, [teamed up with SixSq](https://sixsq.com/news/2020-09-14-news-elektron-trafficdim/) to create a next-generation connected Smart Street Lighting solution called [TrafficDim](https://www.elektron.ch/fr/produits-et-solutions/eclairage/routes/gestion-de-la-lumiere/trafficdim-controle). The solution leverages the power of the [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software and [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview) to command and control the edge devices hosting the adaptive lighting software.
