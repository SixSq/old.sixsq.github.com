An NGO based in Geneva approached SixSq to help with the deployment of an application for field clinics in various locations around the world. They needed a robust, scalable solution that did not require an on-site IT specialist and which would work in areas where connectivity is often volatile. Using [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software and [Nuvla.io](/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview) in combination with the containerised field clinic application, SixSq provided a solution for remote management of the clinic software, including monitoring, updates and alerts.
