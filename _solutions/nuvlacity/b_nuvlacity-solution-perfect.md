Using intelligent edge, we can monitor traffic density in real-time. Based on these measurements we can command street, road and highway segments, delivering optimum lighting conditions at all times. In partnership with [Schréder Swiss](http://www.schreder.com/fr-ch), SixSq has developed a smart street lighting solution which delivers exactly these benefits.  By implementing the [Volumlight](http://www.schreder.com/fr-ch/aboutus/Volumlight)&trade; solution, cities can **ensure light levels are always right, autonomously, without constant supervision**, whilst still respecting safety standards. This solution also delivers significant savings. Operational costs are also reduced thanks to its remote control capabilities.
