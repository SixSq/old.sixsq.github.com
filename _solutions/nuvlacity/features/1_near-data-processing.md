Bring the processing to the data.  Instead of moving tons of data to the cloud, do the sensible thing and take advantage of edge computing.  In the process, process your data in near real-time and reduce your reliance on the network.  Especially, in a smart city context, relying on a high quality network is not so, well... smart.
