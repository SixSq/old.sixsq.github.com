The HNSciCloud project will develop commercial cloud services to help researchers manage and process the enormous amounts of data which will be generated by the scientific community in the coming years. The hybrid cloud platform will enable a competitive marketplace of European cloud players developing their own services for a wider range of users. SixSq delivers the advantages of Nuvla, its multi-cloud management platform, to the project, giving the user group access a wide range of cloud services. The service is based on SlipStream, SixSqâ€™s open source technology which increases quality and speed of application deployment in any cloud.
