SixSq is building the most advanced edge-to-cloud B2B SaaS platform: Nuvla.io.  With the recent acquisition of SixSq by Ekinops, we are fast growing. We are looking for software developers, wanting to join a multi-cultural and international team.  As a software developer you will contribute to the overall objective of the company, which is to disrupt the IT industry with an open, agile, simple and efficient platform. The platform also includes a marketplace of business applications targeting the far edge in a range of sectors such as retail, manufacturing, transport, telecoms and energy.  In time, since we sell as a team, you will also be asked to support sales efforts via creative demonstrations and technical discussions with customers and prospects.

Nuvla.io is mostly built using the functional language Clojure and the web ui Clojurescript. We therefore are looking for developers with experience in functional languages or willing to learn this amazing paradigm and join a great community. The solution also leverages Elasticsearch, Zookeeper and Kafka. And our operations targets public cloud infrastructures and Kubernetes as the container orchestration engine.
