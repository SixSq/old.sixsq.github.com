Creating Awesome User Experience
----

SixSq is currently recruiting a **Web UI and Clojurescript Developer**. As part of the SixSq core development team, the work will
consist in further developing [SlipStream](/products-and-services/slipstream/overview), our [open source](http://ssdocs.sixsq.com) multi-cloud and cloud-to-edge management platform.

You will focus on the Web User Interface (UI), both on the creative side as well as its implementation.  The new UI is based on the Clojurescript language and its eco-system (e.g. React, Reagent, re-frame, Semantic UI).

SlipStream is the foundation technology for SixSq's [Nuvla platform](/products-and-services/nuvla/overview) and [NuvlaBox product](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview), powering our Smart City, Smart Science and Industry 4.0 business.

As part of the SixSq DevOps team, you will also be involved in the development roadmap of the SixSq products and services.  Since each member of the team contributes to the support service, you will be interfacing with customers and users, thus receiving direct feedback from users.

Since SixSq operates as a start-up and follows the kanban agile methodology and DevOps, you must have demonstrated experience and an appetite for operating in this mode. You therefore must be able to thrive in a start-up environment and a flat hierarchy.

The core of the SixSq DevOps team is located in Geneva.  While remote work is possible, especially initially, we would prefer if the selected candidate was to eventually relocate to Geneva.  SixSq employees often work one day per week from home.

Two possible employment models are:

1. Unlimited assignment via a direct Swiss employment contract, with location in Geneva.
2. Consultancy contract.

The employment contract includes a standard package - e.g. 5 weeks holiday (plus public holidays), free public transport in Geneva,
private laptop, etc.

{% comment %} Note: Placement agencies, please do not apply as we require direct assignment. {% endcomment %}

Upon starting the position, you will receive intensive training on the core technologies of SixSq, as well as our DevOps automation environment and the codebase.

Regular travels in Europe for short meetings should be expected.

We are looking for candidates with the following skills and experience:
