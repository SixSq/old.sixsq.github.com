Scale Edge-to-Cloud and Multi-Cloud Operations
----

SixSq is currently recruiting a **lead operations developer** who will
**improve and refine the processes around our production and
pre-production services**.  These processes involve the deployment,
maintenance, and support of our services on cloud and container
infrastructures.

Nuvla is the foundation technology for SixSq's [Nuvla platform](/products-and-services/nuvla/overview) and [NuvlaBox product](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview), powering our Smart City, Smart Science and Industry 4.0 business. With the help of
all DevOps team members, you will ensure that Nuvla and its supporting
services have high levels of reliability and availability.

As a member of the SixSq DevOps team, you will also be involved in the
development of the SixSq products and services.  Since each member of
the team contributes to the support service, you will be interfacing
with customers and users, thus receiving direct feedback from users.

Since SixSq operates as a start-up and follows the kanban agile
methodology and DevOps, you must have demonstrated experience and an
appetite for operating in this mode. You therefore must be able to
thrive in a start-up environment with a flat hierarchy.

As part of the SixSq DevOps team, you are expected to be within daily
commuting distance from the Geneva office.  SixSq employees are
permitted to and often do work from home one day per week.  The
employment contract includes a standard package - e.g. 5 weeks holiday
(plus public holidays), reimbursement of a public transport pass in
Geneva, work laptop, etc. Regular travel in Europe for short meetings
should be expected.

Upon starting the position, you will receive intensive training on the
core technologies of SixSq, current DevOps processes, and information
about our engagements with our current clients and projects.
