Building distributed systems for edge-to-cloud and AI
----

SixSq is currently recruiting a *Junior Clojure and Cloud Developer*. As part of the SixSq core development team, the work will
consist of further developing [Nuvla](/products-and-services/nuvla/overview), an open source multi-cloud management solution.  You will work in extending the product, using primarily the Clojure language and its eco-system.  The stateful backend is based on Elasticsearch and Zookeeper, creating a horizontally scalable infrastructure.

Nuvla is the foundation technology for SixSq's [Nuvla platform](/products-and-services/nuvla/overview) and [NuvlaBox product](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview), powering our Smart City, Smart Science and Industry 4.0 business.

You will be involved in R&D projects, in collaboration with [HES/SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/en/homepage-hes-so-1679.html) (HEPIA and HEG). You will also be involved in the
development roadmap of the SixSq products and services.  Since each member of the team contributes to the support service,
you will be interfacing with customers and users, thus building hands-on knowledge.

Since SixSq operates as a start-up and follows the kanban agile methodology and DevOps, you must have an appetite for operating in this mode. You therefore must be able to thrive in a start-up environment and a flat hierarchy.

The core of the SixSq DevOps team is located in Geneva. 

The employment contract will be awarded by HES/SO.
