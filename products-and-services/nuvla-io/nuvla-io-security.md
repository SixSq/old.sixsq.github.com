Security cannot be left as an afterthought. At SixSq we have built security into the Nuvla.io service by design. Read on to better understand the built-in security primitives, for both Nuvla.io and the [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software, which turns any x86 or ARM single board hardware into a smart edge device. 

We have taken particular care in automating security, in order to remove the number one cause of security issues: human error. But we have done it in a way to puts you at the helm, such that the security context is clear, simple and transparent.

The Nuvla.io security architecture is simple yet comprehensive. It includes the following main parts:

* <i class="fad fa-check"></i> **Connectivity and network security:** ensuring end-to-end security from the data at the edge to the wide area network
* <i class="fad fa-check"></i> **Application security**: ensuring your containerised applications are secure and only run where and when needed and on the right data
* <i class="fad fa-check"></i> **Device system security**: ensuring the operating system is secure, as well as the data it hosts

Don't leave security to chance. With Nuvla.io, security is built in by design. We partner with [security experts](/about/partners), providing you with world class security, even for the most challenging applications in heavily regulated industries.
