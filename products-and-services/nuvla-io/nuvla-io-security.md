## Security First
{: class="text-center fw700 pb-30" style="font-size: 30px;"}

Security cannot be an afterthought. At SixSq we have build security in the Nuvla.io service by design. Read on to better understand the security primitives built-in, on both the service-side (Nuvla.io itself), as well as the [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software, which turns any x86 or ARM single board hardware into a smart edge device.  We have taken particular care in automating security as much as possible, in order to remove the number one cause of security issues: humans. But we have done it in a way to puts you at the helm, such that the security context is clear, simple and transparent.

If you want to read about the details, the online documentation has a dedicated section.
