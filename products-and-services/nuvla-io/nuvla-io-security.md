## Security by Design
{: class="text-center fw700 pb-30" style="font-size: 30px;"}

#### Security cannot be an afterthought. At SixSq we have built security into the Nuvla.io service by design. Read on to better understand the built-in security primitives , for both Nuvla.io the [NuvlaBox](/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) software, which turns any x86 or ARM single board hardware into a smart edge device.  For applications where you need an operating system, we have created the NuvlaBox OS (Operating system, based on Linux), to provide a solid and secure foundation for your edge applications.

<p/>

#### We have taken particular care in automating security, in order to remove the number one cause of security issues: human error. But we have done it in a way to puts you at the helm, such that the security context is clear, simple and transparent.

<p/>

#### If you want to dig into the details, our [<i class="fad fa-book" style="color: #9B1313;"></i> online documentation](https://docs.nuvla.io/nuvla/security) has a dedicated section.

<p/>

#### The Nuvla.io security architecture is simple yet comprehensive. It includes the following main parts:

<p/>

* <i class="fad fa-check"></i> **Connectivity and network security:** ensuring end-to-end security from the data at the edge to the wide area network
* <i class="fad fa-check"></i> **Application security**: ensuring your containerised applications are secure and only run where and when needed and on the right data
* <i class="fad fa-check"></i> **Device system security**: ensuring the operating system is secure, as well as the data it hosts
