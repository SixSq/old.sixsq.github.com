title: About Us
---

SixSq provides agile applications and tools, as well as software services and consultancy. We deliver solutions to reduce costs in managing software and IT infrastructures. SlipStream, our software integration, test and deployment application allows our customers to release software with confidence, minimize risk and reduce time-to-market. SixSq's team members share a passion for excellence and innovation, with dedicated attention to customer needs. We take pride in building long lasting partnerships and collaborations with all of our customers.

Recently we have helped our customers do the following:
* Build public cloud based on the Open Source [StratusLab](/products/stratuslab.html) IaaS solution
* Build vertical solutions using [StratusLab](/products/stratuslab.html) and [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) to provide self-provisioning services of pre-certified domain specific systems
* Help adopt and transition large parts of organisations from waterfall to agile and Scrum processes, using [training and coaching](/products/training-coaching.html)
* Integrate [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html) into public and private cloud services, making it much simpler to manage image creation and complex multi-machine deployments in the cloud
* Automate the entire software development pipeline, using [SlipStream](/products/slipstream.html), doing in a few minutes, on a continuous basis what used to take days

We thrive to push the envelope of what is possible, both at process and technology levels. Challenge us... we love it!
