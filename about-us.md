Our customers are small high-tech organisations, large enterprises and European and international organisations.  SixSq team members share a passion for excellence and innovation, with dedicated attention to customer needs. We strive to build long lasting partnerships and collaborations with all of our customers.

Recently we have helped our customers do the following:
* Build public cloud based on the Open Source [StratusLab](/products/stratuslab.html) IaaS solution
* Build vertical solutions using [StratusLab](/products/stratuslab.html) and [SlipStream™](/products/slipstream.html) to provide self-provisioning services of pre-certified domain specific systems
* Help adopt and transition large parts of organisations from waterfall to agile and Scrum processes, using [training and coaching](/products/training-coaching.html)
* Integrate [SlipStream™](/products/slipstream.html) into public and private cloud services, making it much simpler to manage image creation and complex multi-machine deployments in the cloud
* Automate the entire software development pipeline, using [SlipStream™](/products/slipstream.html), doing in a few minutes, on a continuous basis what used to take days

We thrive to push the envelope of what is possible, both at process and technology levels. Challenge us... we love it!

Over the years, SixSq has built a solid knowledge of the open source hypervisor KVM.  This naturally led us to join the [Open Virtualization Alliance](http://www.openvirtualizationalliance.org/) so that we can contribute to promoting KVM and share our knowledge with other experts in the field.
