    <h1>Software artisans</h1>
    <p>We are software artisans, passionate about software development and technologies. We have learned our trade writing a lot of software. We also enjoy reducing software, using refactoring, or contributing to other's good ideas, such that we do not have to write so much ourselves.</p>
    <p>We hope you enjoy, or will enjoy, using our software; we also hope that you will help us through feedback write better software and continue build the best applications we possibly can.

  <h2>Who we work for?</h2>
  <p>The IT world is littered with complex and intrusive tools and solutions,
promising the world and costing even more. At SixSq we strive to deliver
no-nonsense tools, services and technology, that are powerful, efficient, fun
to use and cost-effective.</p>

  <p>We provide services to: 1. Enterprise and 2. SMBs, NGOs and field operations.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <h3>Enterprise</h3>
    <p>
For enterprise, our flagship product <a href="/products/slipstream/">SlipStream&reg;</a> is designed to deliver automation solutions using cloud computing technology (IaaS) as the underlying
workhorse. This means companies can manage applications' lifecycle using the
convenience of an
<a href="/products/slipstream-usecases.html#Enterprise-App-Store-/-Self-Service-IT">AppStore</a> and deploy their own <a href="/products/slipstream-usecases.html#DevOps-platform">DevOps processes</a> feeding the AppStore.

We support private, public and
<a href="/products/slipstream-usecases.html#Hybrid-Cloud-Provisioning">hybrid</a> cloud
use cases, to ensure that the right cost model is used to meet the evolving need and
capabilities of the enterprise.

Compared to our competitors, our solutions are much simpler and much more cost
effective, both in terms of implementation and operations.  And we build
flexibility in our plans.

Our pricing schemes are clear and simple. Whether you prefer subscription or
license plans, directly or via partners and channels, we will find the right
plan to meet your procurement requirements and preferences.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">
    <h3>SMBs, NGOs and field operations</h3>
    <p>The cloud is a great technology, able to deliver savings, improved agility
and in many ways a game changer. However, the cloud is out of reach of most
Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).

Further, at the edge of the network we find, for example, aid and relief
operations and villages in rural regions of Africa, South-East Asia or South
America.

To fill this gap in cloud computing adoption, we created the <a href="/products/nuvlabox">NuvlaBox</a>,
a semi-connected, turn-key and fan-less appliance, supercharged with our
best software.

The result is a powerful framework able to provide at the point of delivery, an <a href="/products/slipstream-usecases.html#Enterprise-App-Store-/-Self-Service-IT">AppStore</a>
that any non-IT expert can use to manage application deployments.
Several NuvlaBox can also be remotely managed, bringing operations and maintenance
costs right down.

Through creative partnerships, we can deliver several
<a href="/products/nuvlabox-usecases">use cases</a> including:
school-in-a-box, health-in-a-box, clinic-in-a-box, mobile-office-in-a-box, etc.

  <h2>Why trust us?</h2>
  <h4>Experts in the field of cloud and distributed computing, we are also truly
independent, something very few companies can claim.</h4>
  <p/>
  <p>Most cloud companies have a vested interest in one cloud technology or service.
We don't. While we take part in several communities
and events, we ensure our SlipStream cloud automation engine is
agnostic and works great on all the clouds out there.</p>

  <p>This means we can be trusted as a reliable advisor, and believable when we claim
that our solutions isolate CTOs and CIOs from taking the wrong decision when
investing in a given IaaS cloud solution or service.</p>

  <p>Should you use public or private clouds? Or both? Our SlipStream and NuvlaBox
products support all three models. From a pricing point-of-view, we provide
progressive plans so that you can start public or private and then explore
hybrid, or even switch over.</p>

  <p>We also pride ourselves on the loyalty our customers show us with near 100%
recurrent business.</p>
