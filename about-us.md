Who we work for?
==============

The IT world is littered with complex and intrusive tools and solutions,
promising the world and costing even more. At SixSq we strive in delivering
no-nonsense tools, services and technology, that are powerful, efficient, fun
to use and cost-effective.

We have segmented our go-to-market strategy into: 1. *Enterprises* and 2.
*SMBs, NGOs and field operations*. 

Enterprise
----------

For the enterprise, our flagship product
[SlipStream&reg;](/products/slipstream) is designed to deliver
automation solutions using cloud computing technology (IaaS) as the underlying
workhorse. This means enterprises can manage applications lifecycle using the
convenience of an
[AppStore](/products/slipstream-usecases.html#Enterprise-App-Store-/-Self-Service-IT)
and deploy their own
[DevOps processes](/products/slipstream-usecases.html#DevOps-platform)
feeding the AppStore.

We support private, public and
[hybrid](/products/slipstream-usecases.html#Hybrid-Cloud-Provisioning) cloud
use cases, such that right cost model is used to meet the evolving need and
capabilities of the enterprise.

Our solutions compared to competition are much simpler and much more cost
effective, both in terms of implementation and operations.  And we build
flexibility in our plans.

Our pricing schemes are clear and simple. Whether you prefer subscription or
license plans, directly or via partners and channels, we will find the right
plan to meet your procurement requirements and preferences.

SMBs, NGOs and field operations
----------

The cloud is a great technology, able to deliver savings, improved agility
and in many ways a game changer. However, the cloud is out of reach to most
Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).

Further, at the edge of the network we find, for example, aid and relief
operations and villages in rural regions of Africa, South-East Asia or South
America.

To fill this gap in cloud computing adoption, we created the
[NuvlaBox](/products/nuvlabox),
a semi-connected, turn-key and fan-less appliance, supercharged with our
best software.

The result is a powerful framework able to provide at the point of delivery, an [AppStore](/products/slipstream-usecases.html#Enterprise-App-Store-/-Self-Service-IT)
that any non-IT expert can use to manage application deployments.
Several NuvlaBox can also be remotely managed, bring operations and maintenance
costs right down.

Through creative partnerships, we can deliver several
[use cases](/products/nuvlabox-usecases) including:
school-in-a-box, health-in-a-box, clinic-in-a-box, mobile-office-in-a-box, etc.

Why trust us?
==============

Experts in the field of cloud and distributed computing, we are also truly
independent, something very few companies can claim. 
Most cloud companies have a vested interest in one cloud product,
technology and/or community. We don't. While we take part in several communities
and events, for example, we ensure our SlipStream cloud automation engine is
agnostic and works great on all the clouds we support.

This means we can be trusted as a reliable advisor, and trusted when we claim
that our solutions isolate CTOs and CIOs from taking the wrong decision when
investing in a cloud or another.

Should you use public or private clouds? Or both? Our SlipStream and NuvlaBox
products support all three models. From a pricing model point-of-view, we provide
progressive plans so that you can start public or private and then explore
hybrid, or even switch over. 

We also pride ourselves of the loyalty our customers show us with a near 100%
recurrent business.

Partnerships and Collaborations
==============

We collaborate and take part in several partner programs. Here is a summary of
some of the most important relationships we have established in terms of
partnerships and collaborations.
