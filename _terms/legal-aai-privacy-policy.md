3\. How will we use your personal data?
---  

The personal data we collect from you is mostly used to identify you as a user/customer of our products and services (authentication and authorisation). Your personal data (for example email) might also be used to communicate important matters related to your usage and general status (like billing, service maintenances, etc.) of the products and services you've registered for.

Your personal data might also be used to link your user account with third party service providers, such as Docker registries.

Any other personal data processing purposes other than the ones described in this notice will be preceded by a new data processing notice, asking for your consent.

3.1. Access to personal data

SixSq only reserves the rights to manage your personal data, it being entirely owned by you.

If at any time you wish to be provided with a copy of all the information we have about you, you have the right to request it using the contact information provided in section 1.

3.2. Data retention

Personal data can be completely erased on request. Other retention policies include removing personal data of inactive users after a period of 24 months.

3.3. Data integrity

As a data controller, SixSq complies with GDPR when it comes to:
 - protecting personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access;
 - storing, managing and deleting personal data;
 - maintaining full transparency between the data we hold and the user;
 - keeping personal data up to date.

Data integrity is enforced by the implementation of ISO27001 controls.

3.4. Sharing

Personal data is not transferred to any 3rd parties unless:

 - consent has been given by the user, or
 - mandated by the Service Provider for enabling access to its service on its behalf;
 - the 3rd party has undertaken similar duties considered sufficient under the data protection law applicable to the Service Provider.

3.5. Lawfulness of processing (according to [Article 6 of the GDPR](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-6-lawfulness-of-processing-GDPR.htm))

Lawful processing of your personal data is ensured by applying the following:

 - _"the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes"_;

**No special categories of personal data ([Article 9 of the GDPR](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-9-processing-of-special-categories-of-personal-data-GDPR.htm)) are processed by SixSq**.

Where do we keep your personal data?

All personal data is kept within EU and Swiss data centres and might be moved between data centres residing in other countries also within the EU and Switzerland. Personal data is protected according to the [Code of Conduct for Service Providers](https://geant3plus.archive.geant.net/uri/dataprotection-code-of-conduct/v1/Pages/default.aspx), a common standard for the research and higher education sector to protect your privacy.
