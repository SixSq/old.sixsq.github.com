2.4	Any samples, drawings, descriptive matter, or advertising produced by SixSq and any illustrations contained in SixSq's catalogues or brochures are produced for the sole purpose of giving an approximate description of the Products described in them. They shall not form part of the Contract or have any contractual force unless otherwise agreed by SixSq in writing.

3\.	Specification

APPENDIX 1 - Collection/Returns: Process and Related Matters
===

A1\.	Return of defective Goods requiring repair
---

A1.1	Customer contacts SixSq support via email (support@sixsq.com) regarding the Goods that are not properly functioning. SixSq support will review the case and may request additional information or suggest additional diagnostic steps to ensure that the Goods are not returned for repair unnecessarily.

A1.2	If SixSq support concludes that the problems cannot be solved remotely, it will acknowledge that the Goods need to be returned for repair and provide the Customer with a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) form and number.

A1.3	SixSq will either: 

(a) make arrangements with Customer to collect the Goods directly from Customer, leaving Customer with substitute Goods; or  
(b) send Customer replacement Goods together with detailed shipping instructions for returning the defective Goods.

A1.4	In the event SixSq provides Customer with detailed shipping instructions for return, Customer shall write the assigned RMA number on the shipping label and send the defective Goods and a copy of the RMA Form provided by the SixSq to the address received from SixSq. The defective Goods should be returned in either their original packaging or in the packing used for the replacement Goods. Customer shall be liable for any damage and/or subsequent failure of the defective Goods due to inappropriate packaging. 

A1.5	The replacement/return shipping costs, including custom duties and taxes, of replaced/collected/returned Goods are at SixSq’s expense unless the Goods are out of warranty or the Goods have been damaged due to Customer’s fault or due to inappropriate packaging in which case replacement/collection/return shipping costs, duties and taxes shall be at Customer’s expense.

A1.6	SixSq’s repair team shall examine the defective Goods and either: (a) notify Customer that it can retain the substitute Goods as replacement for the defective Goods; or (b) repair/replace the defective Goods and return them to Customer together with return instructions for returning the substitute Goods to SixSq. If the Goods have been damaged due to Customer’s fault, SixSq’s costs for repair and/or replacement shall be payable by Customer to SixSq.

A2\.	No Trouble Found
---

If the returned Goods are fully functional and/or the SixSq’s repair team cannot reproduce the failure reported by Customer, then Customer will be required to pay an evaluation fee and the handling and shipping costs shall be payable by Customer.

A3\.	Additional notes
---

A3.1	SixSq’s standard repair/replacement service is a best effort service. Typically the average turnaround for the standard replacement process is 5 business days from the date of notification of defective Goods to SixSq, but in some cases the delay may be longer and is impacted by factors such as availability of replacement Goods, transportation logistics, customs formalities, etc. SixSq cannot be held responsible for any prejudice or damage that any delay in replacement may cause to Customer. 

A3.2	Shipping/collection of Goods to/from Customer is done using SixSq’s preferred carrier and/or representatives (which may include SixSq’s resellers) and using SixSq’s preferred methods.

A4\.	Collection of Goods following expiry or termination of Contract

Following expiry of the Contract or termination of the Contract for any reason, Customer will make all Goods supplied to it under the Contract available for collection by SixSq in accordance with SixSq’s instructions, or if requested by SixSq, return the Goods following the shipping instructions given to Customer by SixSq. The shipping costs, including custom duties and taxes, for returning Goods are at SixSq’s expense. If Customer: 

(a) fails to make any such Goods available for collection; or  
(b) fails to return Goods in accordance with SixSq’s instructions; and/or  
(c) if any collected/returned Goods are damaged due to Customer’s fault or due to inappropriate packing by Customer, then Customer shall be liable to SixSq for the resulting costs and damages.
