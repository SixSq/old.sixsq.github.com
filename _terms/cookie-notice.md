1\. This Cookie Notice describes how we SixSq Sarl (SixSq or we) use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our web site to collect certain visitor information automatically. It also explains how you can accept or refuse the cookies we serve.

2\. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computerâ€™s hard drive. Cookies allow the website to recognise your device.
