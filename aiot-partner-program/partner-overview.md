Delivering AI to the Market
====

You have an AI solution and are looking to reduce your time to market and deliver an as-a-service experience for your customers? Our Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (AIoT) Partner Programme is there to address this very challenge.

At the same time, many organisations face challenges that AI could address. However, they are unable or reluctant to commit to embracing AI, due to a perceived level of risk associated to such a journey, especially at scale. This is understandable since without access to specialised expertise, the risk of failure is indeed high.

We created **[Nuvla](/nuvla), the software platform for AI enablement at the edge**, to bridge the gap between your AI software solution and your current and future customers. 

To give you an idea of our current activities, we work with partners in the following fields:

* **Smart cities**
* **Smart buildings**
* **Smart retail**
* **Industry 4.0**
* **Mobility**
* **Big Data Science**

Our AIoT partner programme will allow you to accelerates the creation and delivery of applications in these fields and many more.
