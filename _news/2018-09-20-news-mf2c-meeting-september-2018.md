Members of the SixSq team are heading to the historic Oxfordshire town of Abingdon, which claims to be the oldest town in the UK. The reason is not to take part in the famous tradition of bun throwing, but to participate in the next [mF2C](http://www.mf2c-project.eu/) project meeting. Following the recent project review by the European Commission there will be lots to discuss. Having passed the half-way mark in the project, it's a great time to review what is working well and make sure the roadmap is on track.

mF2C is  an [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/) project which is developing a hierarchical, coordinated management platform facilitating the usage of cloud/fog/Internet of Things (IoT) resources.

**Fog computing** brings cloud computing capabilities closer to the end-device and users. When put together, cloud and fog computing create a new stack of resources, which we refer to as Fog-to-Cloud (F2C). The mF2C project has the goal of designing an open, secure, decentralized, multi-stakeholder management framework. The framework sets the foundations for a novel distributed system architecture, developing a proof-of-concept system and platform, which is being tested and validated in three real-world [use cases](http://www.mf2c-project.eu/use-cases/):

- [smart cities](http://www.mf2c-project.eu/use-case-1-emergency-situation-management-in-smart-city-esm/)
- [smart boats](http://www.mf2c-project.eu/use-case-2-sentinel-smart-boat-use-case/)
- [smart hub deployed in an airport](http://www.mf2c-project.eu/use-case-3-the-smart-fog-hub-service-in-airports/)



mF2C source code is published in [Github](https://github.com/mF2C/), so if you are techy and want to have a go, take a look. For a wider audience, [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHLm6stUM9UaOw66Qn3dwdQ/featured) are available which give an overview of the project.

Next week's meeting is being hosted by project partner [Science and Technology Facilities Council](https://stfc.ukri.org/) (STFC), which is one of seven research councils in the UK.
