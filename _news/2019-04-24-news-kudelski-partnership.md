Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland, Phoenix (AZ), USA, and Geneva, Switzerland,  April 24, 2019.

**The companies will address the Industrial IoT market with a joint solution to enable secure edge computing, data collection and critical  decision making.**

**Kudelski will add device and data security capabilities to SixSq’s Nuvla software orchestration service.**

**The solution will enable joint clients to deploy their edge applications with convenience and confidence.**


The [Kudelski Group](https://www.nagra.com/), the world leader in digital security, and SixSq, the leading edge-to-cloud technology solution provider, today announced an agreement to create a joint solution enabling Industrial IoT implementers to **securely manage their edge-based software and data assets**. The solution will work across a wide variety of customer sites and clouds, reducing costs and improving operational efficiency while protecting valuable data and software.

IoT technologies are transforming industries and enabling [smarter cities](https://media.sixsq.com/blog/what-is-a-smart-city). They create operational efficiencies, accelerate new business models and ensure employee and consumer safety. They produce massive amounts of data – from sensors, actuators and other devices in the field – to feed operational decisions, which are increasingly made at the edge by applications that run on local gateways. To safeguard the accuracy of these decisions, these devices and applications must be carefully managed and actively secured. 

As part of the joint agreement, SixSq will provide its global software orchestration service, [Nuvla](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvla/overview), to ease the installation, deployment, management and update of IoT applications at the edge on [NuvlaBoxes](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview). [Kudelski’s IoT Security Platform](https://www.kudelski-iot.com/) will protect IoT devices and gateways from attack so they provide a steady stream of authentic and trusted data to industrial and smart city applications. In addition, the Kudelski solution will ensure that the valuable intellectual property in many of these applications is protected from reverse engineering and tampering. 

Jean-Michel Puiatti, Kudelski Group Senior Vice President for IoT Security: _“Organizations implementing IoT for industrial or smart city applications are achieving great efficiencies and cost savings by making critical decisions at the edge. By working with SixSq, we will provide our clients with the covenience, trust and integrity they need to make those decisions smartly and securely, and ensure actions taken based on those decisions contribute to their growth and success.”_

Marc-Elian Bégin, SixSq CEO and Co-founder: _“Systematic and robust security is paramount in our fast-evolving connected world. Via this partnership with Kudelski, we are delivering possibly the most secured **edge-to-cloud** solution on the market, without adding friction to the ability of our customers and partners to innovate. And with its combined Swiss signature, the result will be appealing for a wide range of applications.”_

The Kudelski IoT Security Platform provides end-to-end protection from silicon to cloud for IoT devices, thereby securely and sustainably enabling new business models and operational efficiencies. The Kudelski IoT Security Platform is a universal platform implemented in different ecosystems with different partners, providing device security, data security, access management and active security for a wide variety of applications and use cases. The Platform has already been adopted by communication service providers, consumer electronics, medical and industrial IoT partners and clients.  

Nuvla, by SixSq, provides a secured edge-to-cloud management platform that enables near-data AI for a connected world, such as smart city and industrial applications. By automating the deployment of containerized applications in any public or private cloud, as well as edge devices, such as SixSq NuvlaBox edge devices, customers gain in productivity and efficiency at scale.
