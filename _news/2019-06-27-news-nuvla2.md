SixSq, the leading edge-to-cloud technology solution provider, today announced a major upgrade of its cloud management platform [Nuvla](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvla/overview).

Nuvla is a [collaboration framework](https://media.sixsq.com/hubfs/Marketing%20Materials/Solutions%20Brief/Nuvla%20collaboration%20framework.pdf) that enables digital transformation and adoption of edge-to-cloud architectures. The platform brings together cloud, edge, AI and IoT, facilitating the implementation of operational edge-to-cloud solutions. 

**What is the motivation behind the upgrade?**

After listening to feedback from customers and partners, the SixSq team has been working hard to make the Nuvla platform even better. Here are some of the drivers:

 * Increase support public clouds, private clouds and private infrastructures
 * Adopt [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container technology for packaging and ease of deployment
 * Built on [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) for scalability
 * Provide an even better [NuvlaBox](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) – more details to come
 * Facilitate on premise deployment for enterprise customers
 * Flexibility to build more solutions such as NuvlaRetail, NuvlaHealth to complement the current portfolio of [NuvlaCity](https://sixsq.com/solutions/nuvlacity/overview) and [NuvlaOutpost](https://sixsq.com/solutions/nuvlaoutpost/overview) and [NuvlaScience](https://sixsq.com/solutions/nuvlascience/overview).

_“Nuvla is a platform that brings together cloud, edge, IoT and AI, providing a complete solution to manage your multi-cloud to edge continuum,”_ said SixSq's CEO Marc-Elian Bégin. _“We think the simplified branding delivers a clearer 
message about SixSq product and services and we are excited about helping our customers on the path to the implementation of successful IoT and smart city projects.”_
 
**What does Nuvla v2 mean for users?**
 
Nuvla refers to the software and [Nuvla.io](https://nuvla.io/ui/welcome), the managed service, thus replacing the brand SlipStream. 

The user interface has been fully revamped to provide a simplified, more enjoyable user experience.
