**Real-time traffic data with energy savings on street lights implemented in Porto and Antwerp**

The EDGELIGHTS project leverages real-time traffic data to provide added-value services in the fields of adaptive lighting, traffic optimisation, and public safety. [Schréder](https://www.schreder.com/), the leading independent outdoor lighting service provider in the world and SixSq have developed the [VolumLight®](https://media.sixsq.com/hubfs/Marketing%20Materials/Solutions%20Brief/NuvlaBox%20Smart%20Street%20Lighting%20Application%202018.pdf) solution, which optimises street lighting based on traffic volume. The proposal is to use the street lighting infrastructure already in play for Volumlight as a platform to host a variety of additional applications, and at the same time leverage from data available in the SynchroniCity framework. For this project, the data-driven adaptive lighting solution has been deployed in two large European cities, Antwerp and Porto.


A key event of the project was the workshops that took place in Antwerp and Porto. Attendees included representatives from public and private infrastructure management as well as from city municipalities Experts in edge computing software and lighting presented the solution and demonstrated the existing deployment in the cities, via informative and hands-on sessions.

The attendees were invited to share their business use cases and challenges in the field of smart cities with a view to finding a solution in the framework of the findings of the project.
