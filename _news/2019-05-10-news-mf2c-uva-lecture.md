[Dr. Cal Loomis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlesloomis/), SixSq CTO, recently had the opportunity to give a lecture to masters students of the [DevOps and Cloud-based Software Development](http://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2018-2019/zoek-vak/vak/63471) course at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

The course, which forms part of UvA's [Software Engineering programme](http://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2018-2019/zoek-opleiding/opleiding/5302/228964) discusses the basic concepts of **DevOps**, including its philosophy, workflow, monitoring methods, and tools. Students apply these concepts to  automate development, test, and release practices. As part of the course, students work in teams to apply the DevOps model and tools to develop working applications and use cloud and DevOps platforms.

The course covers the following topics:

**Introduction to DevOps**, core concepts and models, Continuous Delivery (CD), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment. Agile development, relation to Agile, Scrum, Lean

**Cloud Computing architecture**, service models, virtualisation, resources management and monitoring

**DevOps and software engineering on major cloud platforms**: AWS, Microsoft Azure.

**Cloud automation tools**: Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Nuvla

**Security and Security Development Lifecycle management** (SDLM)

**DevOps applications architecture**, configuration management, environment setups in AWS cloud using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) or [Nuvla](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvla/overview) platform


The programme includes technology lectures, use cases and applications of DevOps, and a number of guest lectures from leading cloud or DevOps/application development and integration companies, including [Sogeti](https://www.sogeti.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Voiceworks](https://www.voiceworks.com/en) and [SixSq](https://sixsq.com/).


_“This focus of my lecture was SixSq's application management platform [Nuvla](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvla/overview), with an emphasis on the evolution of the software and how the push towards the edge was motivated in part by our work with **mF2C**,”_  said Cal. _“The lecture also included a demo of deploying a swarm cluster through Nuvla and then using that cluster via our upcoming “Nuvla 2.0”.”_

SixSq has been part of the [H2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020) [mF2C project](https://www.mf2c-project.eu/) since January 2017. The project is developing a hierarchical, coordinated management platform facilitating the usage of cloud/fog/Internet of Things (IoT) and edge conputing resources, and has been one of the drivers behind recent developments in the SixSq software suite.

Yuri Demchenko, Senior Researcher at the University of Amsterdam said, _“It was quite challenging and risky to start this course "DevOps and Cloud based Software Development" as we did not have any analogy at other universities. So, we needed to do it based on our own experience and relying on contributions from our cooperating companies from different projects. SixSq was one such company from which I learned a lot during our joint work on the [CYCLONE](https://www.cyclone-project.eu/) project. In his lecture, Cal  brought to the course important examples of using **cloud automation tools** and modern trending **container technologies**. Students appreciated the interactive form of the lecture and asked many questions.”_
