HPE pulled out all the stops for the [HPE Discover 2018](https://www.hpe.com/events/discover/) event in Madrid this year. The show was all about technology, apps and data from the **edge** to the cloud and how it can come together to advance the way we all live and work. On top of all the interesting presentations and discussions, participants were treated to an amazing show by performer [Nile Rodgers](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0734755/).

SixSq CEO Marc-Elian BÃ©gin was on stage for the Spotlight session entitled **IoT and AI at the Space Edge: To infinity and beyond** with Vicente Navarro, GNSS Data Science Principal System Engineer at the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/ESA) and [Dr Tom Bradicich](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/contributors/dr-tom-bradicich.html), VP IoT & Edge Systems at HPE. The panelists discussed how they are trying to discover new relationships from GPS satellite signals, while improving GPS precision and how edge, IoT and cloud technologies play a critical role.
