To take account of these special times, the [Swiss Conference on Data Science](https://sds2020.ch/) is playing safe and holding its event on line for the first time this year. The conference brings together data scientists, developers, opinion leaders and decision makers to share ideas on innovative products and services. 

The pre-conference build up includes a full day of interactive workshops organised by the [Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services](https://data-service-alliance.ch/). The wide range of topics includes machine learning, data ethics and data analysis. 

SixSq CEO [Marc-Elian BÃ©gin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mebster/) is presenting the workshop **A Hybrid Edge-Cloud Platform for Self-Adaptive Machine-Learning Based IoT Applications** alongside [Nabil Abdennadher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabil-abdennadher-0446802/), Professor from the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/) and [Francisco Mendonca](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-mendonca/), also from HES-SO.

If you want to know the answer to the following questions, and have a basic knowledge of cloud computing, this workshop is for you:

<ul>
<ul>What problems does edge computing solve?</ul>
<li>How can we take advantage of edge computing?</li>
<li>How do edge computing and cloud computing work together?</li>
<li>How can you balance the load between the edge and the cloud ?</li>
<li>What are the current technologies for designing hybrid platforms (edge, cloud) for secure IoT  applications ?</li> 
</ul>

The workshop includes the hands-on demo of the above technologies and an open-source platform for intelligent IoT applications.
