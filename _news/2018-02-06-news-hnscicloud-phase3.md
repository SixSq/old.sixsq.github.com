SixSq, a cloud solutions provider headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, is part of a consortium selected for the prestigious pilot phase of the [Helix Nebula - the Science Cloud](http://www.hnscicloud.eu/) (HNSciCloud) project. This is one of only two contracts awarded under the final phase of a €5.3 million pre-commercial procurement tender sponsored by ten of Europe’s leading public research organisations and co-funded by the European Union’s [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) Research and Innovation Programme. During this final stage of the project, the consortium will make available 10,000 cores and 1 PB of data, allowing research and scientific institutes to deploy applications at scale on the platform.

Along with [RHEA Group](https://www.rheagroup.com/) as consortium leader, [T-Systems](https://www.t-systems.com/), [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/), [Advania](https://advania.com/) and [Cyfronet](http://www.cyfronet.krakow.pl/en/4421,main.html), SixSq will be working on the challenging needs of the European scientific community in both commercial and hybrid clouds, managing a range of applications, at scale and in a multi-cloud environment.

“We are delighted to be in the final phase of this prestigious contest. Looking at the competition like Indra, IBM and T-Systems, as an SME, it makes our achievement even more impressive. I’m incredibly proud of our amazing team,” said [Marc-Elian Bégin](/about/about-us), SixSq’s CEO.

The [HNSciCloud buyers group](http://www.hnscicloud.eu/about-us/hnscicloud-partners) consists of highly-demanding scientific laboratories and organisations, such as CERN, the world’s largest particle physics lab, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and CNRS, the French National Centre for Scientific Research. The idea behind the project is to bring together public and commercial organisations to provide innovative and cost-effective access to cloud services. This is driven by the big data revolution, requiring scientific communities to process ever-growing amounts of data over the next 10 to 15 years.

Following successful participation in the solution and prototype phases, SixSq will continue to bring the advantages of Nuvla, its multi-cloud management platform, to the pilot phase, giving the user group access a wide range of cloud services. The service is based on SlipStream, SixSq’s open source technology which increases quality and speed of application deployment in any cloud.

The results of the pilot phase will lead to a hybrid cloud platform on which a competitive marketplace of European cloud players can develop their own services for a wider range of users beyond research and science. This forms a solid foundation for building the [European Open Science Cloud](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud).

Charles Loomis, CTO at SixSq commented, “Our Nuvla service is ideal for addressing the elastic and demanding needs of the scientific community in an open and flexible way, while avoiding lock-in.”
