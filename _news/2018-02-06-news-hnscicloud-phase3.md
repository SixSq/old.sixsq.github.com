SixSq is part of a consortium selected for the prestigious pilot phase of the Helix Nebula - the Science Cloud (HNSciCloud) project. This is one of only two contracts awarded under the final phase of a €5.3 million pre-commercial procurement tender sponsored by ten of Europe’s leading public research organisations and co-funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.
