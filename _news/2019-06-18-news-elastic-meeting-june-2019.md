Members of the SixSq team are in the beautiful city of Florence this week for a meeting with other partners in the  [ELASTIC](http://www.elastic-project.eu/) project, which include the [City of Florence](https://www.comune.fi.it/).

**Why Florence?**

Florence has a long history with trams and the tramway network is an important part of the public transport infrastructure of the city. The first horse-drawn tramway was inaugurated in **1879** and already electrified in 1898. After a period of disuse was the lines were repaired and updated in the early 2000s and the Florence administration has invested millions into providing its citizens with a modernised service.  The [latest line](https://www.visitflorence.com/blog/tram-line-t2-open/) linking the city centre to the airport opened as recently February 2019, showing that the city is committed to smart mobility. 

The ELASTIC proejct’s software architecture will be tested in the city and will equip tram vehicles with V2X communication and a variety of detectors aimed at improving traffic management, allowing predictive maintenance and enhancing the tramway operation.

Within the project, SixSq will facilitate the implementation of a transparent cloud to edge ecosystem, with support for cloud-native applications. This will make use of SixSq's expertise in **edge-to-cloud** and **edge-to-edge** products and services to enable smart city and IoT projects.

**About ELASTIC**

ELASTIC (A Software Architecture for Extreme-ScaLe Big-Data AnalyticS in Fog CompuTIng ECosystems) is a European funded project under the grant agreement number 825473, with a budget of €5.9 million. The project started on 1 December 2018 and lasts for 3 years. Coordinated by [BSC](https://www.bsc.es/), the project brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of stakeholders from smart mobility and research domain sectors: Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC, Spain), Ikerlan (Spain), Instituto Superior da Engenharia do Porto (ISEP, Portugal), Information Catalyst (ICE, UK), SixSq (Switzerland), Thales TRT (France), Thales Italia (Italy), Gestione ed Esercizio del Sistema Tranviario (GEST, Italy) and Città Metropolitana di Firenze (Italy).
