The [Helix Nebula - the Science Cloud](http://www.hnscicloud.eu/) (HNSciCloud) project is in its third and final phase. The project will establish a European hybrid cloud platform to support the deployment of high-performance computing and big-data capabilities for scientific research. 

This week, the project's buyers and contractors will meet in Amsterdam to discuss latest developments. The afternoon of the second day will be dedicated to a public session to provide current and potential new users with an overview of the pilot platforms. There will be a presentation of [Onedata](https://onedata.org), the Global data access solution for science, and the other pilot platforms, including that of [RHEA Group](https://www.rheagroup.com/). 
 	
As part of the RHEA Group presentation, SixSq CEO Marc-Elian Bégin will give details of how the multi-cloud management platform service [Nuvla](https://sixsq.com/) is being used. This will include integration with [Exoscale's](https://www.exoscale.com/) cloud services, the voucher scheme for service adoption and the latest devolopments on important services such as quota management and usage monitoring.

After the presentations, test users will share their experiences of the platforms. 

The results of the HNSCiCloud pilot phase will lead to a hybrid cloud platform on which a competitive marketplace of European cloud players can develop their own services for a wider range of users beyond research and science. This forms a solid foundation for building the [European Open Science Cloud](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=open-science-cloud).
