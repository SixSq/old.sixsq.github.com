**SixSq’s Nuvla.io ecosystem facilitates the deployment, management, and update of AI EdgeLab’s cyber security sensors**

**Geneva, 13 June 2022.** SixSq, an Ekinops Company, and [AI EdgeLabs](https://edgelabs.ai/) today announced a partnership to make AI EdgeLabs cyber security sensors available via the Nuvla.io Marketplace. This collaboration significantly simplifies the integration of a complete cyber defense solution for edge/IoT/OT devices, by enabling the purchase, deployment and management of AI EdgeLabs cyber security sensors.

AI EdgeLabs is a powerful and autonomous cybersecurity [AI platform](https://edgelabs.ai/platform/) that helps security teams respond immediately to ongoing attacks and protect Edge/IoT infrastructures against malware, DDoS, botnets, and other threats. AI EdgeLabs delivers cybersecurity measures by bringing network visibility, early threat detection, and automated incident response to the Edge and on-premise environments.

Cybersecurity is not an issue pertaining to specific industries which is why AI EdgeLabs is uniquely designed to solve the pain points of each one, from manufacturing to retail, healthcare, agriculture, telecommunications, transportation and logistics, smart cities, financial services, and more. 

_“To remain competitive, we believe businesses should be protected with real time, AI-powered, and accurate embedded solutions. Said solutions should be easy to deploy, fast, and ready for immediate use. Considering the level of connectivity in the field, AI is the best option to analyse data and secure the Edge and connected IoT/OT”_ says [Inna Ushakova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/innaushakova/), CEO at AI EdgeLabs.

With AI EdgeLabs available in the Nuvla.io Marketplace, companies can now cyber protect their edge assets.

_“EdgeLabs AI sensors can be deployed directly to the Edge Server or IoT/ OT Gateway or to the host operating system. Since we support containers deployment, our solution is ideally suited to work with the Nuvla.io Marketplace. This brings our clients a lot of flexibility and scalability. All data processing is performed at the edge, thus it doesn’t leave the industrial or critical infrastructure perimeter. Your data is your data,”_ says [Oleg Mygryn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miggi/), CTO at AI EdgeLabs.  

With this partnership, it’s easier than ever for enterprise to deploy a proven cyber security solution. 

_“At SixSq we realise the importance of security, which is why we are delighted to be working with AI EdgeLabs to bring their cutting edge cyber security platform to all sectors via the Nuvla.io Marketplace and the App Vendor Programme.”_ said Marc-Elian Bégin, SixSq CEO and Co-founder.

**About AI EdgeLabs**

Similar to our parent company, [Scalarr](https://scalarr.io/), our solution at its core has a straightforward vision: to ensure security to the newest technologies. In the specific case of AI EdgeLabs, the solution was born out of the knowledge we earned from witnessing firsthand how clients were getting constantly attacked across their organization’s Edge and IoT infrastructures, mostly due to lax security measures, outdated or unpatched systems, and a rising number of sophisticated cyber security attacks, to name a few.

With a diverse workforce based out of Ukraine, USA, Mexico, Poland, Israel, and Canada, AI EdgeLabs was founded and is run by security professionals that value humanity, safety, and favorable living conditions for every individual including social, economic, health, and any other factor that plays a part in human wellbeing.

We are the proud recipients of several acknowledgements, cementing our place as the industry’s most accurate solution in the market and culminating in being named one of Forbes’ Top 30 Best Ukrainian Startups in 2021.
