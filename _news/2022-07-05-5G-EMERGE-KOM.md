**Geneva, 5 July, 2022** – SixSq, an [Ekinops](https://www.ekinops.com/) company, is proud to announce its participation in the 5G-EMERGE project, which aims to develop solutions that leverage 5G technology and satellite broadcasting to put Europe at the vanguard of media delivery technology. The project is part of the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA) programme of Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems ([ARTES](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/ARTES/About_ARTES)) and will be led by the European Broadcasting Union ([EBU](https://www.ebu.ch/home)).

The 5G-EMERGE project aims at developing an integrated satellite and terrestrial system based on open standards to enable high-quality content distribution services over multi-layer IP infrastructures. Telecommunications satellites will efficiently deliver high-demand content, including streaming of live events, as close as possible to the end user – to the ‘edge’. The project includes demonstrations in 5G base stations, users' homes and vehicles. 

A consortium of 20 companies from six European countries will collaborate on developing the distributed edge technology and service-delivery features. 

SixSq’s contribution includes leading the demonstration work package and providing the edge-to-cloud software infrastructure based on its [Nuvla.io](https://nuvla.io/) B2B SaaS platform and marketplace of containerised applications, as well as its open source NuvlaEdge software.

SixSq CEO [Marc-Elian Bégin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mebster/) said, _“Leveraging satellite broadcast and 5G is a great opportunity to deliver the right high-density content at the right location with the right customization. How ever, this requires fine-tuned orchestration of the entire value chain and this is what SixSq edge-to-cloud software provides. We are no stranger to big challenges posed by ESA and EBU and are looking forward to pushing the boundaries of edge-to-cloud, bringing together the space sector, 5G and multi-media content delivery.”_

_“The 5G-Emerge project is yet another example of Ekinops’ long commitment towards software innovation as a means to add value to the telecommunications sector”, commented [Vincent Munière](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muniere/), Group Chief Technology Officer & VP R&D at Ekinops. “We are looking forward to helping set the bar in 5G services and content delivery."_

For SixSq, this project is a unique opportunity to showcase its edge computing software’s ability to orchestrate complex scenarios for a range of new commercial use-cases, ranging from maritime, vehicle, public transport, 5G and building applications.  Working with market leaders in their domain, Nuvla.io will manage apps across the edge-to-cloud continuum.
