**Multi-Party Recognition Framework for Cloud Security Certifications brings clarity to the compliance process**

**Continuous Auditing Based Certification increases trust in assurance process**

**Privacy Code of Conduct helps cloud service providers understand GDPR readiness & demonstrate compliance**


SixSq has been proud to be part of the European Security Certification Framework [EU-SEC](https://www.sec-cert.eu/) project for the last three years. The main aim of EU-SEC is to improve **trust in cloud services** by creating a framework under which existing certification and assurance approaches can co-exist. The framework serves basic requirements of the **EU Cybersecurity Act** and adds an additional layer of trust, assurance and transparency by including continuous auditing-based certifications. It is targeted at cloud stakeholders wishing to improve the business value, efficiency and effectiveness of their approach to cloud security certification schemes. This includes auditors, cloud service providers, regulators, standard owners and cloud users. 

In addition to all the work required to build the framework architecture, the project partners have worked hard to produce a variety of materials to ensure the project outcomes remain at the disposal of cloud stakeholders. The resources include:

•	[White papers](https://www.sec-cert.eu/eu-sec/papers)

•	[Videos](https://www.sec-cert.eu/videos-fbb262b58aaf62e7)

•	[Training packages](https://www.sec-cert.eu/training-packages-c0e25e2c13ee66b1)

Jürgen Grossman, coordinator of the EU-SEC project said, _“There have been many challenges over the last three years, but I am proud of the results that EU-SEC has achieved.  These results have been obtained thanks to the hard work of all the partners who brought their expertise to the consortium. I’m confident the outcomes will deliver benefits to European cloud stakeholders.”_

SixSq would like to encourage anyone interested in benefiting from the framework to get in touch via the project’s website [https://www.sec-cert.eu/](https://www.sec-cert.eu/)


The EU-SEC project, which will come to an end on 31 December 2019,  has received funding from the European Union’s HORIZON Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 731845.

SixSq’s participation in the [EU-SEC](https://sixsq.com/r-and-d/eusec) project is supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation [SERI](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html).
