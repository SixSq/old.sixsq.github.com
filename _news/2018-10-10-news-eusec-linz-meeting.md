**EU-SEC - The chance to boost clarity in cloud certification**

Members of the [EU-SEC](https://www.sec-cert.eu/) project are heading to the beautiful city of Linz in Austria next week for a meeting with the project's advisory board and the general assembly of all partners. 

The partners will discuss the continued development of the [multi-party recognition framework](https://www.sec-cert.eu/eu-sec/Multi-Party_Recognition_Framework) and address the current challenges. Special emphasis will be placed on the importance of the pilots.

The EU-SEC framework will equip stakeholders in the ICT security ecosystem with a validated governance structure, a reference architecture, and the corresponding set of tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their current approach to security governance, risks management, assurance and compliance. The EU-SEC aims to enhance trustworthiness and transparency in the ICT supply chain through business cases developed and piloted by industrial partners.

When the discussions are over, there is plenty in Linz to keep the participants happy, with the attractions of the River Danube and the delicious Linzer torte, the oldest cake in the world.
