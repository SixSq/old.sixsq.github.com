Members of the SixSq team are on the beautiful Italian island of Favignana this week for the 8th plenary meeting of the [SCISSOR](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/644425) project.

**What is SCISSOR all about?**

The SCISSOR project is designing a new generation supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) security monitoring framework to allow for connected, yet secure, industrial control systems. These control systems are present in nearly every industrial sector and critical infrastructure such as the manufacturing, transportation, energy, and water treatment industries.

**Why Favignana?**

One of the SCISSOR consortium members is [SEA SOCIETA’ ELETTRICA di Favignana](http://www.seafavignana.com/) (SEA) S.p.a., which is the electrical energy producer and distribution operator of Favignana island. The company currently produces around 14.000.000 kWh of energy per year and has 3,500 end users. SEA has put one of its sub-stations at the project’s disposal and this station has been fully equipped with sensors, audio and video equipment and one of of SixSq’s NuvlaBoxes.

One of the important aims of this week’s meeting is to upgrade the system to improve network monitoring. This will ensure that the electricity provider is warned in case of a cyber attack, for example if the network is subject to flooding, a technique employed to compromise the security of networks.

The SCISSOR system guarantees monitoring on three levels:

- IT Security via continuous network monitoring
Environmental security is ensured thanks to sensors installed in the cabin
Physical security is monitored via audio and video installations
The analysis of the information provided by the sensors is done within the NuvlaBox and then passed to the central elements of the SCISSOR system to alert operators of unusual situations and possibly to take corrective actions automatically. Raw information is also passed to the decision making elements to update the machine learning algorithms so that they evolve with the platform.

**What’s next?**

The experience from the existing Favignana deployment over the last 9 months has led to a number of improvements. Testing those improvements and an end-to-end validation of the SCISSOR platform will be the focus in the remainder of the project, which continues until 31 December 2017. The project then hopes to announce its innovative, production-ready platform.

**Who is involved?**

The SCISSOR project involves 9 partners from 6 countries:

- Assystem, France
- AGH University of Science and Technology of Krakow, Poland
- UPMC university Pierre and Marie Curie, France
- SixSq, Switzerland
- CNIT (National Inter-University Consortium for Telecommunications), Italy
- RADIO6ENSE, Italy
- Salzburg Research Forschungsgesellschaft, Austria
- Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium
- SEA Società Elettrica di Favignana S.p.a., Italy


SCISSOR is funded through the European Commission’s H2020 programme under grant agreement 644425. SixSq is supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI under contract number 15.0022.
