**IoT smart city pilot will deliver energy savings to European cities thanks to data-driven solution**

[Schréder](https://www.schreder.com/), the leading independent outdoor lighting service provider in the world and SixSq, a cloud and edge solutions provider based in Geneva, have been chosen by the European Union’s [SynchroniCity](https://synchronicity-iot.eu/) programme to deploy a data-driven adaptive lighting solution in two large European cities, Antwerp and Porto. The team is one of only 16 pilots selected from 131 groups who responded to the call.  

This six-month project will leverage real-time traffic data to provide added-value services in the fields of **adaptive lighting**, **mobility** and **public safety**. The solution, known as [VolumLight®](https://media.sixsq.com/hubfs/Marketing%20Materials/Solutions%20Brief/NuvlaBox%20Smart%20Street%20Lighting%20Application%202018.pdf), was developed by Schréder in partnership with SixSq, and forms part of SixSq’s NuvlaCity IoT platform. VolumLight® provides a local and autonomous system which delivers **energy savings exceeding 30%**.  This innovation provides a street lighting controlled in accordance with traffic volume increasing safety and reducing light emissions and at the same time providing the city with relevant traffic data for further use in mobility analysis and planning.

_“VolumLight® is the proof that existing infrastructure can be digitalized to bring social and environmental benefits” explained Nicolas Keutgen, Schréder CIO. “SynchroniCity challenges the participants to find solutions to local problems, enabling cities and partners to collaborate and share their experiences.”_

The intelligent lighting solution will be implemented in the cities of Antwerp and Porto. VolumLight® will be installed on selected stretches of road in both cities. The beauty of the system is that it leverages the existing lighting infrastructure and perfectly integrates with cities’ existing smart city strategies. 

_“We are delighted to have been selected for this pilot, especially considering how competitive it was,” said Marc-Elian Bégin, SixSq’s CEO.  “This is about using data and IoT to deliver scalable, sustainable and meaningful improvements to citizens’ life and the environment.”_
