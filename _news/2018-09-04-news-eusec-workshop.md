**Contribute to improving trust, assurance and compliance in the ICT market**

The HORIZON 2020 European Security Certification [EU-SEC](http://www.sec-cert.eu/) Project will provide first results of the multi-party recognition framework for cloud services. Together with DIGITALEUROPE, they will introduce the project, the policy work in DIGITALEUROPE and the European Cyber Security Strategy.

The aim of this workshop is to reflect the achievements and progress of the EU-SEC project and discuss the mutual recognition between cloud compliance schemes with key stakeholders.

**Who should attend and why?**

- Cloud Users: benefit from facilitated comparability of cloud service’s security level
- Cloud Service Providers: **reduce compliance costs** by reducing audit efforts
- Scheme owners and authorities: have your compliance scheme integrated in EU-SEC. 
- Auditors: use the framework to **facilitate audits** and optimise your client’s service experience.

The full agenda is available [here](https://cdn0.scrvt.com/fokus/97a05e0223ad853f/5c12826a9af6/EU-SEC-Workshop-Announcement---Agenda---2018-09-03.pdf).  A member of the SixSq team will be presenting the results achieved so far on the multi-party recognition framework pilot schemes.
