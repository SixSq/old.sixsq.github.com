The final review of the [Helix Nebula - the Science Cloud](http://www.hnscicloud.eu/) (HNSciCloud) project took place at CERN last week. Sponsored by ten of Europe’s leading public research organisations and co-funded by the European Union’s [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/) Research and Innovation Programme, HNSciCloud has laid the foundations of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) business model. 

To keep a pace with the huge amounts of **scientific data** being collected, scientific researchers in fields such as high energy physics, lifescience & astronomy need to increase the capacity for data analysis. A Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) project was therefore launched in January 2016 to pull together commercial cloud service providers, publicly funded e-Infrastructures and the buyers’ in-house resources to build a hybrid cloud platform.

Along with [RHEA Group](https://www.rheagroup.com/) as consortium leader, [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/), [Cyfronet](http://www.cyfronet.krakow.pl/en/4421,main.html), and [Advania](https://advania.com/) SixSq worked on these challenging needs of the European scientific community in both commercial and hybrid clouds, managing a range of applications, at scale and in a multi-cloud environment. The challenge was to build a cost-effective solution at scale, with minimum disruption to the users's sites. As well as technical expertise and leadership, SixSq's  multi-cloud management platform [Nuvla](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvla/overview) was used to simplify and automate management of cloud applications. 

The project has published a great [booklet](https://www.hnscicloud.eu/sites/default/files/files/HNSC_BookletA5_November2018_21081123_web.pdf#overlay-context=bridging-cloud-computing-innovation-open-science-hnscicloud-booklet) which brings together all the achievements, including details of the use cases. For example, using HNSciCloud, the PanCancer project will be able to determine genetic variation for more than 5000 tumor samples with more coming in on a monthly basis.
