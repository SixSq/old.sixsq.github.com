**Next-generation solution for smart, efficient street lighting**

- ELEKTRON teamed up with software technology expert and CERN spin-off SixSq to create a next-generation connected Smart Street Lighting solution. 

- TrafficDim is the first industrialised solution of its kind and was developed 100% in Switzerland.

- The solution has been specially engineered for major traffic axes - where it pays off most to reduce energy and light pollution.


**Geneva / Au (ZH)** – [ELEKTRON](www.elektron.ch) has been testing traffic-dependent lighting control systems in various pilot projects (Wädenswil/Smart City Lab Basel Wolf) for some time now. Right from the start, ELEKTRON worked closely with cantonal civil engineering offices and traffic engineers, as they already use traffic sensor technology for their analyses. Now ELEKTRON has teamed up with the software technology expert and CERN spin-off SixSq. Together they developed the first industrialised traffic-based lighting solution in Switzerland

_“We had been working on the topic for some time and had examined different approaches. Only when we started the collaboration with SixSq we made progress. SixSq understood us right from the start and implemented our wishes incredibly fast and competently”_. 
said Enrico Baumann, CEO ELEKTRON AG.

TrafficDim is ideally suited for adjusting the light intensity on busy roads. It reduces energy consumption and light emissions while complying with the applicable safety standards and norms. The solution achieves this by controlling street lighting based on real-time traffic monitoring. The data is automatically analysed on SixSq's secure edge-to-cloud management platform [Nuvla.io](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvla-io/overview), which allows for easy processing of the collected traffic data and continuously transmits the information to the CityTouch lighting management system to control the luminaires.

_“I am impressed with how ELEKTRON has leveraged Nuvla.io to create something new,”_ said Marc-Elian Bégin, SixSq CEO and Co-founder. 

“With TrafficDim, ELEKTRON has integrated our real-time monitoring capabilities at the edge with the Signify CityTouch light management system to deliver an industrial scale product. This solution will make smart cities safer and more energy efficient.”
