**Tune in to the BRAINE panel series**

The [BRAINE project](https://www.braine-project.eu/) is developing an edge infrastructure for local big data processing and artificial intelligence. Edge Cloud software running in micro data centres will be a game changer in many settings, including hospitals, cities, factories and logistical hubs. Building a successful solution, however, comes with challenges and complexities that have to be unravelled. 

The project's **[Ask BRAINE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9i1A21WUkxj9Epo-WA3KFP_SUwu9_H6S)** panel series has been put together to look at some of these fascinating and often complex issues surrounding AI, edge computing and big data. 

The second panel is the series is entitled **Artificial Intelligence in Edge Computing** and will explore topics such as:

- What is the role of AI at the edge?

- What is the best way to build edge and AI capabilities?

- What is the role of governance?

- How can privacy be protected?

- What about cyber attacks?
