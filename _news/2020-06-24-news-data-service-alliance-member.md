The Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services is making a significant contribution towards transforming Switzerland into an internationally recognised hub for data-driven value creation. This organisation focuses on cooperation within an interdisciplinary expert network of innovative companies and universities with the aim of pooling knowledge from a variety of different areas, including information technology, artificial intelligence, business and psychology, in order to produce market-ready products and services.
