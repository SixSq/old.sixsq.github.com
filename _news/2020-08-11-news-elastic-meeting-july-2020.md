As a consequence of the latest COVID-19 restrictions, the last [ELASTIC](http://www.elastic-project.eu/) project meeting could not take place in Porto, Portugal as planned. Thanks to the flexibility and willingness of the consortium partners, it was carried out online, with more than 25 people from 8 different organisations and 6 countries participating in a Zoom conference for two consecutive days. What was expected to be a chaotic and unproductive meeting, turned out to be an outstanding example of efficiency and organisation. All partners had time to report on their work and call for discussions, which would in turn, very often, extend beyond the initial time slot allocated for that topic. However, these discussions were conducted in such a manner that they would cover other reports and topics that were scheduled to be addressed later, showing that everything converged nicely to the work in hand at the time of this meeting.

Many partners (SixSq included), also had the time to showcase and demonstrate some of the practical work that has been developed for the project and that shall be presented at the mid-term review meeting in September.

Despite the disruptions caused by COVID-19 in the city of Florence (where the [ELASTIC use-cases](https://elastic-project.eu/use-case) take place), all ELASTIC members have successfully converged on a technical roadmap that will allow for quicker commissioning of the use-cases. This is being achieved via agile planning and parallelisation of tasks. For example,  the containerisation of the use-case applications is moving in parallel with the certification and testing of the fog computing architecture and hardware, which is also moving in parallel with the integration of the [ELASTIC software](https://elastic-project.eu/software-infrastructure) and fog computing architectures, plus the consolidation of the [non-functional requirements](https://elastic-project.eu/results/publications/non-functional-requirements-elastic-architecture) and data analytics models.
