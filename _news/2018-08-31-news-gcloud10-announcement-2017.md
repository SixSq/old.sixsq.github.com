We are pleased to announce that SixSq has been approved to supply the UK public sector with cloud hosting services under [G-Cloud 10](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-small-businesses-lined-up-for-g-cloud-10).  

**What is G-Cloud 10?**

The G-Cloud framework is part of the UK's Digital Marketplace, which has been put in place to help public sector organisations to find, compare and select potential providers for digital projects. Buying services through the framework means that organisations can save on the time and cost of entering into individual procurement contracts. Suppliers are carefully evaluated during the tender process and pre-agreed terms and conditions offer customers sound contractual safeguards.

**What is SixSq offering on G-Cloud 10?**

SixSqâ€™s [NuvlaBox](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/overview) features in the Cloud Hosting category. It is a turnkey instant private cloud and edge solution which is secure, affordable and simple to use. It includes a plug and play device with remote management & application update capabilities. A non-technical operator can easily and securely set up the appliance, which plays a key part in smart city solutions. Municipalities wishing to implement smart street lighting can use NuvlaBox as part of their strategy, as demonstrated by the [Volumlight](https://sixsq.com/solutions/nuvlacity/overview) application.
